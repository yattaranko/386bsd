       zero ‚Äî the zero‚Äêfill device

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mzero [22mdevice reads as if an infinitely long file of zeros.  Like the
       [4mnull[24m(4)  device, the [1mzero [22mdevice accepts and reads data as any ordinary
       (and willing) file - but throws it away. The length of the [1mzero  [22mdevice
       is always zero.
