[1mNAME[0m
       core ‚Äî memory image file format

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <sys/param.h>[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       A small number of signals which cause abnormal termination of a process
       also  cause  a  record  of the process‚Äôs in‚Äêcore state to be written to
       disk for later examination by one of the  aviailable  debuggers.   (See
       [4msigaction[24m(2).)    This   memory  image  is  written  to  a  file  named
       [1mprogname.core [22min the working directory, where progname is  replaced  by
       the name of the program; provided the terminated process had write per‚Äê
       mission in the directory, the filesystem on which the working directory
       is  on was not mounted with the option [4mnocore[24m (See [4mmount[24m(8) ), and pro‚Äê
       vided the abnormality did not cause a system crash.   (In  this  event,
       the decision to save the core file is arbitrary, see [4msavecore[24m(8).)

       The  maximum  size  of  a  [1mcore [22mfile is limited by [4msetrlimit[24m(2).  Files
       which would be larger than the limit are not created.  Also, the kernel
       tries hard to not overwrite an existing file unless it is  in  standard
       coredump format and was produced from the same program.

       The  [1mcore  [22mfile  consists of the [4mu[24m.  area, whose size (in pages) is de‚Äê
       fined by the UPAGES manifest in the ‚ü®[4msys/param.h[24m‚ü© file.  The  [4mu[24m.   area
       starts  with  a [4muser[24m structure as given in ‚ü®[4msys/user.h[24m‚ü©.  The remainder
       of the [1mcore [22mfile consists of the data pages followed by the stack pages
       of the process image.  The amount of data space image in the [1mcore  [22mfile
       is  given  (in  pages)  by  the  variable [4mu_dsize[24m in the [4mu[24m.  area.  The
       amount of stack image in the core file is given (in pages) by the vari‚Äê
       able [4mu_ssize[24m in the [4mu[24m.  area.  The size of a ‚Äò‚Äòpage‚Äô‚Äô is given  by  the
       constant NBPG (also from ‚ü®[4msys/param.h[24m‚ü©).
