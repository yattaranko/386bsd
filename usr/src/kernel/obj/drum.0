[1mNAME[0m
       drum ‚Äî paging device

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This  file  refers to the paging device in use by the system.  This may
       actually be a subdevice of one of the disk drivers,  but  in  a  system
       with  paging interleaved across multiple disk drives it provides an in‚Äê
       direct driver for the multiple drives.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mdrum [22mspecial file appeared in 3.0BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
       Reads from the drum are not allowed across the interleaving boundaries.
       Since these only occur every .5Mbytes or so, and since the system never
       allocates blocks across the boundary, this is usually not a problem.
