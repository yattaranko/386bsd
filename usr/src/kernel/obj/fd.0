[1mNAME[0m
       fd, stdin, stdout, stderr â€” file descriptor files

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  files  [4m/dev/fd/0[24m through [4m/dev/fd/#[24m refer to file descriptors which
       can be accessed through the file system.  If  the  file  descriptor  is
       open and the mode the file is being opened with is a subset of the mode
       of the existing descriptor, the call:

             fd = open("/dev/fd/0", mode);

       and the call:

             fd = fcntl(0, F_DUPFD, 0);

       are equivalent.

       Opening the files [4m/dev/stdin[24m, [4m/dev/stdout[24m and [4m/dev/stderr[24m is equivalent
       to the following calls:

             fd = fcntl(STDIN_FILENO,  F_DUPFD, 0);
             fd = fcntl(STDOUT_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);
             fd = fcntl(STDERR_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);

       Flags  to the [4mopen[24m(2) call other than O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY and O_RDWR are
       ignored.
