[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Services  provide  by  modules  other  than the core kernel module (see
       [4mkern[24m(9) ) that may or may not be loaded in the kernel  program  may  be
       accessed from all other modules via the external symbol table.  This is
       the  way  an  optionally, dynamically bound symbol can be accessed from
       any part of the kernel, unlike the statically bound symbols in the  re‚Äê
       set of the program.

       Symbols  are  manually  entered into the external symbol table with the
       [1mesym_bind[22m() function, that associates the symbol name with  a  specific
       kernel  address.   These  addresses  can  be  then  recovered  via  the
       [1mesym_fetch[22m() function, which obtains the address associated with a sym‚Äê
       bol of the given name which was already bound. Symbols can  be  rebound
       by  breaking  the binding with the [1mesym_unbind[22m() function, allowing the
       symbol to be bound differently with another [1mesym_bind[22m() call.

       While symbols are bound explicitly by the kernel  modules  implementing
       the  services  used  elsewhere,  service  clients  implicitly  use  the
       [1mesym_fetch[22m() function via inline stub functions and macros  present  in
       include  files  (located  adjacent  to  the function prototypes for the
       functions implemented).

       The external symbol table does not use dynamic memory allocation or any
       blocking resource, thus is usable anywhere in the kernel program.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The [1mesym_fetch[22m() function returns an address of the symbol if  present;
       otherwise a null address is returned.
