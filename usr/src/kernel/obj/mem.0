[1mNAME[0m
       mem, kmem â€” memory files

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The special file [1m/dev/mem [22mis an interface to the physical memory of the
       computer.  Byte offsets in this file are interpreted as physical memory
       addresses.   Reading and writing this file is equivalent to reading and
       writing memory itself.  Only offsets within the bounds of [1m/dev/mem  [22mare
       allowed.

       Kernel  virtual  memory  is accessed through the interface [1m/dev/kmem [22min
       the same manner as [1m/dev/mem[22m.  Only kernel virtual  addresses  that  are
       currently mapped to memory are allowed.

[1mI386 ARCHETECTURE DETAILS[0m
       On  ISA  the I/O memory space begins at physical address 0x000a0000 and
       runs to 0x00100000.  The kernel virtual address space (usually)  starts
       at address 0xfe000000, and each process/thread kernel stack is uniquely
       located in the kernel heap above the kernel program.
