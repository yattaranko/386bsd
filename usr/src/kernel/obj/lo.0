[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mloop[22m.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mloop  [22minterface is a software loopback mechanism which may be used
       for performance analysis, software testing, and/or local communication.
       As with other network interfaces, the loopback interface must have net‚Äê
       work addresses assigned for each address family with which it is to  be
       used.   These  addresses  may  be  set  or changed with the SIOCSIFADDR
       [4mioctl[24m(2).  The loopback interface should be the last interface  config‚Äê
       ured,  as protocols may use the order of configuration as an indication
       of priority.  The loopback should [4mnever[24m be configured first  unless  no
       hardware interfaces exist.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mlo [22mdevice appeared in 4.2BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
       Previous versions of the system enabled the loopback interface automat‚Äê
       ically,  using a nonstandard Internet address (127.1).  Use of that ad‚Äê
       dress is now discouraged; a reserved host address for the local network
       should be used instead.
