[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       These routines convert 16 and 32 bit quantities  between  network  byte
       order  and  host byte order.  On machines which have a byte order which
       is the same as the network order, routines are defined as null macros.

       These routines are most often used in  conjunction  with  Internet  ad‚Äê
       dresses and ports as returned by [4mgethostbyname[24m(3) and [4mgetservent[24m(3).

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mbyteorder [22mfunctions appeared in 4.2BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
       On  the  VAX bytes are handled backwards from most everyone else in the
       world.  This is not expected to be fixed in the near future.
