       nice ‚Äî set program scheduling priority

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mnice[22m([4mint[24m [4mincr[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mThis interface is obsoleted by setpriority(2).[0m

       The [1mnice[22m() function obtains the scheduling priority of the process from
       the  system  and  sets it to the priority value specified in [4mincr[24m.  The
       priority is a value in the range ‚Äê20 to 20.  The default priority is 0;
       lower priorities cause more favorable scheduling.  Only the  super‚Äêuser
       may lower priorities.

       Children inherit the priority of their parent processes via [4mfork[24m(2).
