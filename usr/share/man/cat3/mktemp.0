[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mmktemp[22m() function takes the given file name template and overwrites
       a  portion  of  it to create a file name.  This file name is unique and
       suitable for use by the application.  The template may be any file name
       with some number of ‚ÄòXs‚Äô appended to it,  for  example  [4m/tmp/temp.XXXX[24m.
       The trailing ‚ÄòXs‚Äô are replaced with the current process number and/or a
       unique  letter  combination.   The number of unique file names [1mmktemp[22m()
       can return depends on the number of ‚ÄòXs‚Äô provided; six ‚ÄòXs‚Äô will result
       in [1mmktemp[22m() testing roughly 26 ** 6 combinations.

       The [1mmkstemp[22m() function makes the same replacement to the  template  and
       creates  the  template  file,  mode  0600,  returning a file descriptor
       opened for reading and writing.  This avoids the race  between  testing
       for a file‚Äôs existence and opening it for use.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The  [1mmktemp[22m() function returns a pointer to the template on success and
       NULL on failure.  The [1mmkstemp[22m() function returns -1 if no suitable file
       could be created.  If either call fails an error code is placed in  the
       global variable [4merrno[24m.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The  [1mmktemp[22m()  and [1mmkstemp[22m() functions may set [4merrno[24m to one of the fol‚Äê
       lowing values:

       [ENOTDIR]  The pathname portion of the template is not an existing  di‚Äê
                  rectory.

       The  [1mmktemp[22m()  and  [1mmkstemp[22m() functions may also set [4merrno[24m to any value
       specified by the [4mstat[24m(2) function.

       The [1mmkstemp[22m() function may also set [4merrno[24m to any value specified by the
       [4mopen[24m(2) function.
