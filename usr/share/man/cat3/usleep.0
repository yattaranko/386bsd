[1mNAME[0m
       usleep ‚Äî suspend execution for interval of microseconds

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mvoid[0m
       [1musleep[22m([4mu_int[24m [4mmicroseconds[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1msleep[22m()  function  suspends  execution  of the calling process for
       [4mmicroseconds[24m of time.  System activity or time spent in processing  the
       call may lengthen the sleep slightly.

       If  a  timer  is already running on the process its state is saved.  If
       the value [4mmicroseconds[24m is more than or equal  to  the  remaining  clock
       time  for the saved timer, the sleep time is set to the remaining clock
       time.  The state of the previous timer is restored  after  [4mmicroseconds[0m
       has passed.

       This  routine is implemented using [4msetitimer[24m(2); it requires eight sys‚Äê
       tem calls each time it is invoked.  A similar but less compatible func‚Äê
       tion can be obtained with a single [4mselect[24m(2); such a function would not
       restart after signals, but would  not  interfere  with  other  uses  of
       [4msetitimer[24m.

       The [1musleep[22m() function appeared in 4.3BSD.
