[1mNAME[0m
       ungetc — un‐get character from input stream

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <stdio.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1mungetc[22m([4mint[24m [4mc[24m, [4mFILE[24m [4m*stream[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mungetc[22m() function pushes the character [4mc[24m (converted to an  unsigned
       char)  back  onto  the  input stream pointed to by [4mstream[24m.  The pushed‐
       backed characters will be returned by subsequent reads  on  the  stream
       (in  reverse  order).   A  successful  intervening call, using the same
       stream, to one of the file positioning functions ([4mfseek[24m(3), [4mfsetpos[24m(3),
       or [4mrewind[24m(3)) will discard the pushed back characters.

       One character of push‐back is guaranteed, but as long as there is  suf‐
       ficient memory, an effectively infinite amount of pushback is allowed.

       If  a  character is successfully pushed‐back, the end‐of‐file indicator
       for the stream is cleared.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The [1mungetc[22m() function returns the character pushed‐back after the  con‐
       version, or EOF if the operation fails.  If the value of the argument [4mc[0m
       character  equals  EOF, the operation will fail and the stream will re‐
       main unchanged.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The [1mungetc[22m() function conforms to ANSI X3.159‐1989 (“ANSI C89”).
