[1mNAME[0m
       siginterrupt ‚Äî allow signals to interrupt system calls

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <signal.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1msiginterrupt[22m([4mint[24m [4msig[24m, [4mint[24m [4mflag[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1msiginterrupt[22m()  function is used to change the system call restart
       behavior when a system call is interrupted by the specified signal.  If
       the flag is false (0), then system calls will be restarted if they  are
       interrupted  by  the  specified signal and no data has been transferred
       yet.  System call restart is the default behavior on 4.2BSD.

       If the flag is true (1), then restarting of system calls  is  disabled.
       If a system call is interrupted by the specified signal and no data has
       been  transferred, the system call will return -1 with the global vari‚Äê
       able [4merrno[24m set to EINTR.  Interrupted system calls  that  have  started
       transferring  data will return the amount of data actually transferred.
       System call interrupt is the signal behavior found on 4.1BSD  and  AT&T
       System V UNIX systems.

       Note  that  the new 4.2BSD signal handling semantics are not altered in
       any other way.  Most notably, signal handlers always  remain  installed
       until  explicitly  changed  by  a subsequent [4msigaction[24m(2) call, and the
       signal mask operates  as  documented  in  [4msigaction[24m(2).   Programs  may
       switch  between  restartable and interruptible system call operation as
       often as desired in the execution of a program.

       Issuing a [1msiginterrupt[22m([4m3[24m) call during the execution of a signal handler
       will cause the new action to take  place  on  the  next  signal  to  be
       caught.

[1mNOTES[0m
       This  library routine uses an extension of the [4msigaction[24m(2) system call
       that is not available in 4.2BSD, hence it should not be used  if  back‚Äê
       ward compatibility is needed.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       A 0 value indicates that the call succeeded.  A -1 value indicates that
       an invalid signal number has been supplied.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1msiginterrupt[22m() function appeared in 4.3BSD.
