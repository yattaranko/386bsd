[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mgetloadavg[22m() function returns the number of processes in the system
       run  queue  averaged over various periods of time.  Up to [4mnelem[24m samples
       are retrieved and assigned to successive elements  of  [4mloadavg[24m[].   The
       system  imposes  a maximum of 3 samples, representing averages over the
       last 1, 5, and 15 minutes, respectively.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       If the load average was unobtainable, -1 is  returned;  otherwise,  the
       number of samples actually retrieved is returned.
