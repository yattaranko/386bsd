[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mfgetc[22m() function obtains the next input character (if present) from
       the stream pointed at by [4mstream[24m, or the next character pushed  back  on
       the stream via [4mungetc[24m.

       The  [1mgetc[22m()  function acts essentially identically to [1mfgetc[22m(), but is a
       macro that expands in‚Äêline.

       The [1mgetchar[22m() function is equivalent to: getc with the argument stdin.

       The [1mgetw[22m() function obtains the next [4mint[24m (if present) from  the  stream
       pointed at by [4mstream[24m.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       If successful, these routines return the next requested object from the
       [4mstream[24m.   If  the  stream is at end‚Äêof‚Äêfile or a read error occurs, the
       routines return EOF.  The routines [4mfeof[24m(3) and [4mferror[24m(3) must  be  used
       to  distinguish between end‚Äêof‚Äêfile and error.  If an error occurs, the
       global variable [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the  error.   The  end‚Äêof‚Äêfile
       condition  is  remembered,  even  on a terminal, and all subsequent at‚Äê
       tempts to read will return EOF until  the  condition  is  cleared  with
       [4mclearerr[24m.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The [1mfgetc[22m(), [1mgetc[22m() and [1mgetchar[22m() functions conform to ANSI X3.159‚Äê1989
       (‚ÄúANSI C89‚Äù).

[1mBUGS[0m
       Since  EOF  is  a  valid integer value, [4mfeof[24m and [4mferror[24m must be used to
       check for failure after calling [1mgetw[22m().  The size and byte order of  an
       [4mint[24m  varies  from one machine to another, and [1mgetw[22m() is not recommended
       for portable applications.
