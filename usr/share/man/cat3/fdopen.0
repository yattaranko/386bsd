[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mfopen[22m() function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to
       by [4mpath[24m and associates a stream with it.

       The  argument [4mmode[24m points to a string beginning with one of the follow‚Äê
       ing sequences (Additional characters may follow these sequences.):

       ‚Äú[1mr[22m‚Äù     Open text file for reading.  The stream is  positioned  at  the
               beginning of the file.

       ‚Äú[1mr+[22m‚Äù    Open  for reading and writing.  The stream is positioned at the
               beginning of the file.

       ‚Äú[1mw[22m‚Äù     Truncate file to zero length or create text file  for  writing.
               The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.
       Open  for  reading and writing.  The file is created if it does not ex‚Äê
               ist, otherwise it is truncated.  The stream  is  positioned  at
               the beginning of the file.

       ‚Äú[1ma[22m‚Äù     Open  for  writing.   The file is created if it does not exist.
               The stream is positioned at the end of the file.

       ‚Äú[1ma+[22m‚Äù    Open for reading and writing.  The file is created if  it  does
               not exist.  The stream is positioned at the end of the file.

       The  [4mmode[24m  string  can  also include the letter ‚Äò‚Äòb‚Äô‚Äô either as a third
       character or as a character between the characters in any of  the  two‚Äê
       character  strings described above.  This is strictly for compatibility
       with ANSI X3.159‚Äê1989 (‚ÄúANSI C89‚Äù) and has no effect; the ‚Äò‚Äòb‚Äô‚Äô is  ig‚Äê
       nored.

       Any created files will have mode "S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP
       |  S_IROTH  |  S_IWOTH" ([1m0666[22m), as modified by the process‚Äô umask value
       (see [4mumask[24m(2)).

       Reads and writes may be intermixed on read/write streams in any  order,
       and  do  not  require  an  intermediate seek as in previous versions of
       [4mstdio[24m.  This is not portable to other systems, however; ANSI C requires
       that a file positioning function intervene between  output  and  input,
       unless an input operation encounters end‚Äêof‚Äêfile.

       The  [1mfdopen[22m()  function  associates a stream with the existing file de‚Äê
       scriptor, [4mfildes[24m.  The [4mmode[24m of the stream must be compatible  with  the
       mode of the file descriptor.

       The  [1mfreopen[22m() function opens the file whose name is the string pointed
       to by [4mpath[24m and associates the stream pointed to by [4mstream[24m with it.  The
       original stream (if it exists) is closed.  The [4mmode[24m  argument  is  used
       just  as in the [4mfopen[24m function.  The primary use of the [1mfreopen[22m() func‚Äê
       tion is to change the file  associated  with  a  standard  text  stream
       ([4mstderr[24m, [4mstdin[24m, or [4mstdout[24m).

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon  successful  completion  [1mfopen[22m(),  [1mfdopen[22m() and [1mfreopen[22m() return a
       FILE pointer.  Otherwise, NULL is  returned  and  the  global  variable
       [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [EINVAL]  The  [4mmode[24m provided to [1mfopen[22m(), [1mfdopen[22m(), or [1mfreopen[22m() was in‚Äê
                 valid.

       The [1mfopen[22m(), [1mfdopen[22m() and [1mfreopen[22m() functions may  also  fail  and  set
       [4merrno[24m for any of the errors specified for the routine [4mmalloc[24m(3).

       The  [1mfopen[22m() function may also fail and set [4merrno[24m for any of the errors
       specified for the routine [4mopen[24m(2).

       The [1mfdopen[22m() function may also fail and set [4merrno[24m for any of the errors
       specified for the routine [4mfcntl[24m(2).

       The [1mfreopen[22m() function may also fail and set [4merrno[24m for any of  the  er‚Äê
       rors specified for the routines [4mopen[24m(2), [4mfclose[24m(3) and [4mfflush[24m(3).

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The  [1mfopen[22m()  and  [1mfreopen[22m()  functions  conform  to  ANSI  X3.159‚Äê1989
       (‚ÄúANSI C89‚Äù).  The [1mfdopen[22m() function conforms to IEEE  Std  1003.1‚Äê1988
       (‚ÄúPOSIX.1‚Äù).
