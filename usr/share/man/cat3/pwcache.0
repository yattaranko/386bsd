[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mThis interface is not part of the C library.  It has been placed in the[0m
       [1mBerkeley  utility  library,  libutil, as it is used by several standard[0m
       [1mutilities.[0m

       The [1muser_from_uid[22m() function returns the user name associated with  the
       argument  [4muid[24m.  The user name is cached so that multiple calls with the
       same [4muid[24m do not require additional calls to [4mgetpwuid[24m(3).  If  there  is
       no user associated with the [4muid[24m, a pointer is returned to an ASCII rep‚Äê
       resentation  of  the  [4muid[24m,  unless  the argument [4mnouser[24m is non‚Äêzero, in
       which case a NULL pointer is returned.

       The [1mgroup_from_gid[22m() function returns the group  name  associated  with
       the argument [4mgid[24m.  The group name is cached so that multiple calls with
       the  same [4mgid[24m do not require additional calls to [4mgetgrgid[24m(3).  If there
       is no group associated with the [4mgid[24m, a pointer is returned to an  ASCII
       representation  of the [4mgid[24m, unless the argument [4mnogroup[24m is non‚Äêzero, in
       which case a NULL pointer is returned.

[1mHISTORY[0m

       development.
