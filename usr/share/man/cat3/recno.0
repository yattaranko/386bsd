[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  routine [4mdbopen[24m is the library interface to database files.  One of
       the supported file formats is record number  files.   The  general  de‚Äê
       scription  of  the database access methods is in [4mdbopen[24m(3), this manual
       page describes only the recno specific information.

       The record number data structure is  either  variable  or  fixed‚Äêlength
       records  stored  in  a flat‚Äêfile format, accessed by the logical record
       number.  The existence of record number five implies the  existence  of
       records  one through four, and the deletion of record number one causes
       record number five to be renumbered to record number four, as  well  as
       the  cursor,  if  positioned after record number one, to shift down one
       record.

       The recno access method specific data structure provided to  [4mdbopen[24m  is
       defined in the <db.h> include file as follows:

       typedef struct {
              u_char bval;
              u_int cachesize;
              index_t psize;
              u_long flags;
              int lorder;
              size_t reclen;
              char *bfname;
       } RECNOINFO;

       The elements of this structure are defined as follows:

       bval   The  delimiting  byte to be used to mark the end of a record for
              variable‚Äêlength records, and the pad character for  fixed‚Äêlength
              records.   If  no value is specified, newlines (‚Äò‚Äò\n‚Äô‚Äô) are used
              to mark the end  of  variable‚Äêlength  records  and  fixed‚Äêlength
              records are padded with spaces.

       cachesize
              A  suggested  maximum size, in bytes, of the memory cache.  This
              value is [1monly [22madvisory, and the access method will allocate more
              memory rather than fail.  If [4mcachesize[24m is  0 (no size is  speci‚Äê
              fied) a default cache is used.

       psize  The  recno  access  method  stores  the  in‚Äêmemory copies of its
              records in a btree.  This value is the size (in  bytes)  of  the
              pages  used for nodes in that tree.  If [4mpsize[24m is 0 (no page size
              is specified) a page size is chosen based on the underlying file
              system I/O block size.  See [4mbtree[24m(3) for more information.

       bfname The recno access method  stores  the  in‚Äêmemory  copies  of  its
              records  in  a  btree.   If bfname is non‚ÄêNULL, it specifies the
              name of the btree file, as if specified as the file name  for  a
              dbopen of a btree file.

       flags  The  flag value is specified by [4mor[24m‚Äôing any of the following val‚Äê
              ues:

              R_FIXEDLEN
                     The records are fixed‚Äêlength, not  byte  delimited.   The
                     structure  element  [4mreclen[24m  specifies  the  length of the
                     record, and the structure element [4mbval[24m is used as the pad
                     character.

              R_NOKEY
                     In the interface  specified  by  [4mdbopen[24m,  the  sequential
                     record  retrieval fills in both the caller‚Äôs key and data
                     structures.  If the R_NOKEY flag is specified, the [4mcursor[0m
                     routines are not required to fill in the  key  structure.
                     This  permits applications to retrieve records at the end
                     of files without reading all of the intervening records.

              R_SNAPSHOT
                     This flag requires that a snapshot of the file  be  taken
                     when  [4mdbopen[24m is called, instead of permitting any unmodi‚Äê
                     fied records to be read from the original file.

       lorder The byte order for integers in  the  stored  database  metadata.
              The  number  should represent the order as an integer; for exam‚Äê
              ple, big endian order would be the number 4,321.  If [4mlorder[24m is 0
              (no order is specified) the current host order is used.

       reclen The length of a fixed‚Äêlength record.

       The data part of the key/data pair used by the recno access  method  is
       the  same  as  other  access  methods.  The key is different.  The [4mdata[0m
       field of the key should be a pointer  to  a  memory  location  of  type
       [4mrecno_t[24m,  as defined in the <db.h> include file.  This type is normally
       the largest unsigned integral type  available  to  the  implementation.
       The [4msize[24m field of the key should be the size of that type.

       In the interface specified by [4mdbopen[24m, using the [4mput[24m interface to create
       a  new record will cause the creation of multiple, empty records if the
       record number is more than one greater than  the  largest  record  cur‚Äê
       rently in the database.
