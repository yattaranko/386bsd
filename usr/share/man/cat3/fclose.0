[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mfclose[22m() function dissociates the named [4mstream[24m from its underlying
       file or set of functions.  If the stream was being used for output, any
       buffered data is written first, using [4mfflush[24m(3).

       Upon successful completion 0 is returned.  Otherwise, EOF  is  returned
       and  the global variable [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.  In either
       case no further access to the stream is possible.

       specified for the routines [4mclose[24m(2) or [4mfflush[24m(3).
