[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mgetusershell[22m() function returns a pointer to a legal user shell as
       defined by the system manager in the file [4m/etc/shells[24m.  If  [4m/etc/shells[0m
       is  unreadable  or does not exist, [1mgetusershell[22m() behaves as if [4m/bin/sh[0m
       and [4m/bin/csh[24m were listed in the file.

       The [1mgetusershell[22m() function reads the next line (opening  the  file  if
       necessary); [1msetusershell[22m() rewinds the file; [1mendusershell[22m() closes it.

       [1mgetusershell[22m() will modify the same object.
