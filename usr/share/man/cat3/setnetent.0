[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mgetnetent[22m(), [1mgetnetbyname[22m(), and [1mgetnetbyaddr[22m() functions each  re‚Äê
       turn a pointer to an object with the following structure containing the
       broken‚Äêout fields of a line in the network data base, [4m/etc/networks[24m.

             struct  netent {
                     char            *n_name;        /* official name of net */
                     char            **n_aliases;    /* alias list */
                     int             n_addrtype;     /* net number type */
                     unsigned long   n_net;          /* net number */
             };

       The members of this structure are:

       [4mn_name[24m      The official name of the network.

       [4mn_aliases[24m   A zero terminated list of alternate names for the network.

       [4mn_addrtype[24m  The  type  of  the  network number returned; currently only
                   AF_INET.

       [4mn_net[24m       The network number.  Network numbers are  returned  in  ma‚Äê
                   chine byte order.

       The  [1mgetnetent[22m()  function reads the next line of the file, opening the
       file if necessary.

       The [1msetnetent[22m() function opens and rewinds the file.  If  the  [4mstayopen[0m
       flag  is non‚Äêzero, the net data base will not be closed after each call
       to [1mgetnetbyname[22m() or [1mgetnetbyaddr[22m().

       The [1mendnetent[22m() function closes the file.

       The [1mgetnetbyname[22m() function and [1mgetnetbyaddr[22m() sequentially search from
       the beginning of the file until a matching net name or net address  and
       type  is  found, or until EOF is encountered.  Network numbers are sup‚Äê
       plied in host order.

       Null pointer (0) returned on EOF or error.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The  [1mgetnetent[22m(),  [1mgetnetbyaddr[22m(),  [1mgetnetbyname[22m(),  [1msetnetent[22m(),   and
       [1mendnetent[22m() functions appeared in 4.2BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The  data  space  used  by these functions is static; if future use re‚Äê
       quires the data, it should be copied before  any  subsequent  calls  to
       these  functions  overwrite it.  Only Internet network numbers are cur‚Äê
       rently understood.  Expecting network numbers to fit in no more than 32
       bits is probably naive.
