[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mThese interfaces are obsoleted by random(3).[0m

       The  [1mrand[22m()  function  computes a sequence of pseudo‚Äêrandom integers in
       the range of 0 to RAND_MAX (as defined by the header file ‚ü®[4mstdlib.h[24m‚ü©).

       The [1msrand[22m() function sets its argument as the seed for a  new  sequence
       of pseudo‚Äêrandom numbers to be returned by [1mrand[22m().  These sequences are
       repeatable by calling [1msrand[22m() with the same seed value.

       If  no  seed  value is provided, the functions are automatically seeded
       with a value of 1.
