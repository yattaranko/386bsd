[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The routine [1mns_addr[22m() interprets character strings representing XNS ad‐
       dresses, returning binary information suitable for use in system calls.
       The  routine  [1mns_ntoa[22m()  takes  XNS addresses and returns ASCII strings
       representing the address in a notation in common use in the  Xerox  De‐
       velopment Environment:

             <network number>.<host number>.<port number>

       Trailing  zero  fields  are  suppressed,  and each number is printed in
       hexadecimal, in a format suitable for input to [1mns_addr[22m().   Any  fields
       lacking super‐decimal digits will have a trailing ‘H’ appended.

       Unfortunately,  no  universal  standard exists for representing XNS ad‐
       dresses.  An effort has been made to insure that [1mns_addr[22m() be  compati‐
       ble with most formats in common use.  It will first separate an address
       into  1  to  3  fields using a single delimiter chosen from period ‘.’,
       colon ‘:’ or pound‐sign ‘#’.  Each field is then examined for byte sep‐
       arators (colon or period).  If there are byte separators, each subfield
       separated is taken to be a small hexadecimal number, and  the  entirety
       is  taken as a network‐byte‐ordered quantity to be zero extended in the
       high‐network‐order bytes.  Next, the field is inspected for hyphens, in
       which case the field is assumed to be a number in decimal notation with
       hyphens separating the millenia.  Next, the field is assumed  to  be  a
       number: It is interpreted as hexadecimal if there is a leading ‘0x’ (as
       in C), a trailing ‘H’ (as in Mesa), or there are any super‐decimal dig‐
       its  present.  It is interpreted as octal is there is a leading ‘0’ and
       there are no super‐octal digits.  Otherwise, it is converted as a deci‐
       mal number.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mns_addr[22m() and [1mns_toa[22m() functions appeared in 4.3BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The string returned by [1mns_ntoa[22m() resides in a static memory area.   The
       function  [1mns_addr[22m()  should diagnose improperly formed input, and there
       should be an unambiguous way to recognize this.
