       fgetline ‚Äî get a line from a stream

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <stdio.h>[0m

       [4mchar[24m [4m*[0m
       [1mfgetline[22m([4mFILE[24m [4m*stream[24m, [4msize_t[24m [4m*len[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mfgetline[22m()  function  returns  a pointer to the next line from the
       stream referenced by [4mstream[24m.  The newline character at the end  of  the
       line is replaced by a NUL.

       If  [4mlen[24m is non‚ÄêNULL, the length of the line, not counting the terminat‚Äê
       ing NUL, is stored in the memory location it references.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion a pointer is returned; this pointer  becomes
       invalid  after  the next I/O operation on [4mstream[24m (whether successful or
       not) or as soon as the stream is closed.  Otherwise, NULL is  returned.
       The  [1mfgetline[22m()  function  does not distinguish between end‚Äêof‚Äêfile and
       error; the routines [4mfeof[24m(3) and [4mferror[24m(3) must  be  used  to  determine
       which  occurred.  If an error occurrs, the global variable [4merrno[24m is set
       to indicate the error.  The end‚Äêof‚Äêfile condition is  remembered,  even
       on a terminal, and all subsequent attempts to read will return NULL un‚Äê
       til the condition is cleared with [4mclearerr[24m(3).

       The text to which the returned pointer points may be modified, provided
       that no changes are made beyond the terminating NUL.  These changes are
       lost as soon as the pointer becomes invalid.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [EBADF]  The argument [4mstream[24m is not a stream open for reading.

       The  [1mfgetline[22m() function may also fail and set [4merrno[24m for any of the er‚Äê
       rors specified for the routines [4mfflush[24m(3), [4mmalloc[24m(3), [4mread[24m(2), [4mstat[24m(2),
       or [4mrealloc[24m(3).

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mfgetline[22m() function is currently under development.

[1mBUGS[0m
       It is not possible to tell whether the final line of an input file  was
       terminated with a newline.
