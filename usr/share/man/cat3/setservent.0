[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mgetservent[22m(), [1mgetservbyname[22m(), and [1mgetservbyport[22m()  functions  each
       return  a  pointer to an object with the following structure containing
       the broken‚Äêout fields of a line in  the  network  services  data  base,
       [4m/etc/services[24m.

             struct  servent {
                     char    *s_name;        /* official name of service */
                     char    **s_aliases;    /* alias list */
                     int     s_port;         /* port service resides at */
                     char    *s_proto;       /* protocol to use */
             };

       The members of this structure are:

       [4ms_name[24m     The official name of the service.

       [4ms_aliases[24m  A zero terminated list of alternate names for the service.

       [4ms_port[24m     The  port number at which the service resides.  Port numbers
                  are returned in network byte order.

       [4ms_proto[24m    The name of the protocol to use when contacting the service.

       The [1mgetservent[22m() function reads the next line of the file, opening  the
       file if necessary.

       The  [1msetservent[22m() function opens and rewinds the file.  If the [4mstayopen[0m
       flag is non‚Äêzero, the net data base will not be closed after each  call
       to [1mgetservbyname[22m() or [1mgetservbyport[22m().

       The [1mendservent[22m() function closes the file.

       The  [1mgetservbyname[22m()  and [1mgetservbyport[22m() functions sequentially search
       from the beginning of the file until a matching protocol name  or  port
       number  is  found,  or until EOF is encountered.  If a protocol name is
       also supplied (non‚Äê NULL), searches must also match the protocol.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       Null pointer (0) returned on EOF or error.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mgetservent[22m(), [1mgetservbyport[22m(), [1mgetservbyname[22m(),  [1msetservent[22m(),  and
       [1mendservent[22m() functions appeared in 4.2BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
       These  functions use static data storage; if the data is needed for fu‚Äê
       ture use, it should be copied before any subsequent calls overwrite it.
       Expecting port numbers to fit in a 32 bit quantity is probably naive.
