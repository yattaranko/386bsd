[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       These functions operate on the group database file [4m/etc/group[24m which  is
       described  in  [4mgroup[24m(5).   Each  line of the database is defined by the
       structure [4mgroup[24m found in the include file ‚ü®[4mgrp.h[24m‚ü©:

             struct group {
                     char    *gr_name;       /* group name */
                     char    *gr_passwd;     /* group password */
                     gid_t   gr_gid;         /* group id */
                     char    **gr_mem;       /* group members */
             };

       The functions [1mgetgrnam[22m() and [1mgetgrgid[22m() search the group  database  for
       the  given  group name pointed to by [4mname[24m or the group id pointed to by
       [4mgid[24m, respectively, returning  the  first  one  encountered.   Identical
       group names or group gids may result in undefined behavior.

       The  [1mgetgrent[22m()  function  sequentially reads the group database and is
       intended for programs that wish to step through the  complete  list  of
       groups.

       All three routines will open the group file for reading, if necesssary.

       The  [1msetgroupent[22m()  function opens the file, or rewinds it if it is al‚Äê
       ready open.  If [4mstayopen[24m is non‚Äêzero, file descriptors are  left  open,
       significantly  speeding functions subsequent calls.  This functionality
       is unnecessary for [1mgetgrent[22m() as it doesn‚Äôt close its file  descriptors
       by default.  It should also be noted that it is dangerous for long‚Äêrun‚Äê
       ning  programs  to  use this functionality as the group file may be up‚Äê
       dated.

       The [1msetgrent[22m() function is identical to [1msetgroupent[22m() with an  argument
       of zero.

       The [1mendgrent[22m() function closes any open files.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The  functions [1mgetgrent[22m(), [1mgetgrnam[22m(), and [1mgetgrgid[22m(), return a pointer
       to the group entry if successful; if end‚Äêof‚Äêfile is reached or an error
       occurs a null pointer is returned.   The  functions  [1msetgroupent[22m()  and
       [1msetgrent[22m()  return  the value 1 if successful, otherwise the value 0 is
       returned.  The functions [1mendgrent[22m()  and  [1msetgrfile[22m()  have  no  return
       value.

[1mFILES[0m
       [4m/etc/group[24m  group database file

[1mSEE ALSO[0m

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The  functions  [1mendgrent[22m(),  [1mgetgrent[22m(),  [1mgetgrnam[22m(),  [1mgetgrgid[22m(),  and
       [1msetgrent[22m() appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.  The functions  [1msetgrfile[22m()
       and [1msetgroupent[22m() appeared in 4.3BSD-Reno.

[1mCOMPATIBILITY[0m
       The  historic  function [1msetgrfile[22m(), which allowed the specification of
       alternate password databases, has been  deprecated  and  is  no  longer
       available.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The  functions  [1mgetgrent[22m(),  [1mgetgrnam[22m(),  [1mgetgrgid[22m(), [1msetgroupent[22m() and
       [1msetgrent[22m() leave their results in an internal static object and  return
       a  pointer  to  that object. Subsequent calls to the same function will
       modify the same object.

       The functions [1mgetgrent[22m(), [1mendgrent[22m(), [1msetgroupent[22m(), and [1msetgrent[22m() are
       fairly useless in a networked environment and  should  be  avoided,  if
       possible.
