       [1mgetwd[22m([4mchar[24m [4m*buf[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mgetcwd[22m() function copies the absolute pathname of the current work‚Äê
       ing  directory  into the memory referenced by [4mbuf[24m and returns a pointer
       to [4mbuf[24m.  The [4msize[24m argument is the size, in bytes, of the  array  refer‚Äê
       enced by [4mbuf[24m.

       If  [4mbuf[24m is NULL, space is allocated as necessary to store the pathname.
       This space may later be [4mfree[24m(3)‚Äôd.

       The function [1mgetwd[22m() is a compatibility routine  which  calls  [1mgetcwd[22m()
       with  its  [4mbuf[24m argument and a size of MAXPATHLEN (as defined in the in‚Äê
       clude  file  ‚ü®[4msys/param.h[24m‚ü©).   Obviously,  [4mbuf[24m  should  be   at   least
       MAXPATHLEN bytes in length.

       These  routines  have  traditionally  been used by programs to save the
       name of a working directory for the purpose of returning to it.  A much
       faster and less error‚Äêprone method of accomplishing this is to open the
       current directory (‚Äò.‚Äô) and use the [4mfchdir[24m(2) function to return.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion, a pointer  to  the  pathname  is  returned.
       Otherwise  a  NULL pointer is returned and the global variable [4merrno[24m is
       set to indicate the error.  In addition, [1mgetwd[22m() copies the error  mes‚Äê
       sage associated with [4merrno[24m into the memory referenced by [4mbuf[24m.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The [1mgetcwd[22m() function will fail if:

       [EACCESS]  Read  or search permission was denied for a component of the
                  pathname.

       [EINVAL]   The [4msize[24m argument is zero.

       [ENOENT]   A component of the pathname no longer exists.

       [ENOMEM]   Insufficient memory is available.

       [ERANGE]   The [4msize[24m argument is greater than zero but smaller than  the
                  length of the pathname plus 1.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mchdir[24m(2), [4mfchdir[24m(2), [4mmalloc[24m(3), [4mstrerror[24m(3)

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The  [1mgetcwd[22m()  function conforms to ANSI X3.159‚Äê1989 (‚ÄúANSI C89‚Äù).  The
       ability to specify a NULL pointer and have [1mgetcwd[22m() allocate memory  as
       necessary is an extension.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mgetwd[22m() function appeared in 4.0BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The  [1mgetwd[22m()  function does not do sufficient error checking and is not
       able to return very long, but valid, paths.  It is provided for compat‚Äê
       ibility.
