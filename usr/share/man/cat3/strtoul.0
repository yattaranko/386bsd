       strtoul — convert a string to an unsigned long integer

       [1mstrtoul[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*nptr[24m, [4mchar[24m [4m**endptr[24m, [4mint[24m [4mbase[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mstrtoul[22m() function converts the string in [4mnptr[24m to an [4munsigned[24m [4mlong[0m
       value according to the given [4mbase[24m, which must be between 2 and  36  in‐
       clusive, or be the special value 0.

       The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space (as deter‐
       mined by [4misspace[24m(3)) followed by a single optional ‘+’ or ‘‐’ sign.  If
       [4mbase[24m  is zero or 16, the string may then include a ‘0x’ prefix, and the
       number will be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero [4mbase[24m is taken  as  10
       (decimal)  unless  the next character is ‘0’, in which case it is taken
       as 8 (octal).

       The remainder of the string is converted to an [4munsigned[24m [4mlong[24m  value  in
       the  obvious  manner, stopping at the end of the string or at the first
       character that does not produce a valid digit in the given  base.   (In
       bases above 10, the letter ‘A’ in either upper or lower case represents
       10, ‘B’ represents 11, and so forth, with ‘Z’ representing 35.)

       If [4mendptr[24m is non nil, [1mstrtoul[22m() stores the address of the first invalid
       character  in  [4m*endptr[24m.   If  there  were  no  digits  at all, however,
       [1mstrtoul[22m() stores the original value of  [4mnptr[24m  in  [4m*endptr[24m.   (Thus,  if
       [4m*nptr[24m is not ‘\0’ but [4m**endptr[24m is ‘\0’ on return, the entire string was
       valid.)

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The  [1mstrtoul[22m() function returns either the result of the conversion or,
       if there was a leading minus sign, the negation of the  result  of  the
       conversion,  unless the original (non‐negated) value would overflow; in
       the latter case, [1mstrtoul[22m() returns ULONG_MAX and sets the global  vari‐
       able [4merrno[24m to ERANGE.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [ERANGE]  The  given  string  was out of range; the value converted has
                 been clamped.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The [1mstrtoul[22m() function conforms to ANSI X3.159‐1989 (“ANSI C89”).

[1mBUGS[0m
       Ignores the current locale.
