[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       These  functions  operate  on  the  password database file which is de‚Äê
       scribed in [4mpasswd[24m(5).  Each entry in the database  is  defined  by  the
       structure [4mpasswd[24m found in the include file ‚ü®[4mpwd.h[24m‚ü©:

             struct passwd {
                     char    *pw_name;       /* user name */
                     char    *pw_passwd;     /* encrypted password */
                     uid_t   pw_uid;         /* user uid */
                     gid_t   pw_gid;         /* user gid */
                     time_t  pw_change;      /* password change time */
                     char    *pw_class;      /* user access class */
                     char    *pw_gecos;      /* Honeywell login info */
                     char    *pw_dir;        /* home directory */
                     char    *pw_shell;      /* default shell */
                     time_t  pw_expire;      /* account expiration */
             };

       The  functions  [1mgetpwnam[22m()  and [1mgetpwuid[22m() search the password database
       for the given login name or user uid,  respectively,  always  returning
       the first one encountered.

       The [1mgetpwent[22m() function sequentially reads the password database and is
       intended for programs that wish to process the complete list of users.

       The  [1msetpassent[22m() function accomplishes two purposes.  First, it causes
       [1mgetpwent[22m() to ‚Äò‚Äòrewind‚Äô‚Äô to the beginning of the  database.   Addition‚Äê
       ally, if [4mstayopen[24m is non‚Äêzero, file descriptors are left open, signifi‚Äê
       cantly  speeding up subsequent accesses for all of the routines.  (This
       latter functionality is unnecessary for [1mgetpwent[22m() as it doesn‚Äôt  close
       its file descriptors by default.)

       It  is dangerous for long‚Äêrunning programs to keep the file descriptors
       open the database will become out of date if it is  updated  while  the
       program is running.

       The  [1msetpwent[22m()  function is identical to [1msetpassent[22m() with an argument
       of zero.

       The [1mendpwent[22m() function closes any open files.

       These routines have been written to ‚Äò‚Äòshadow‚Äô‚Äô the password file,  e.g.
       allow  only  certain programs to have access to the encrypted password.
       If the process which calls them has an effective  uid  of  0,  the  en‚Äê
       crypted password will be returned, otherwise, the password field of the
       retuned structure will point to the string ‚Äò*‚Äô.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The  functions  [1mgetpwent[22m(),  [1mgetpwnam[22m(), and [1mgetpwuid[22m(), return a valid
       pointer to a passwd structure on success and a null pointer if  end‚Äêof‚Äê
       file  is  reached  or  an error occurs.  The functions [1msetpassent[22m() and
       [1msetpwent[22m() return 0 on failure and 1 on success.  The [1mendpwent[22m()  func‚Äê
       tion has no return value.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The  [1mgetpwent[22m, [1mgetpwnam[22m, [1mgetpwuid[22m, [1msetpwent, [22mand [1mendpwent [22mfunctions ap‚Äê
       peared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.  The  [1msetpassent  [22mfunction  appeared  in
       4.3BSD-Reno.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The  functions  [1mgetpwent[22m(), [1mgetpwnam[22m(), and [1mgetpwuid[22m(), leave their re‚Äê
       sults in an internal static object and return a pointer to that object.
       Subsequent calls to the same function will modify the same object.

       The routines [1mgetpwent[22m(), [1mendpwent[22m(), [1msetpassent[22m(), and  [1msetpwent[22m()  are
       fairly  useless  in  a  networked environment and should be avoided, if
       possible.

[1mCOMPATIBILITY[0m
       The historic function [4msetpwfile[24m(3), which allowed the specification  of
       alternate  password  databases,  has  been  deprecated and is no longer
       available.
