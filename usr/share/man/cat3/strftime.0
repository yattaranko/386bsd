[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mstrftime[22m() function formats the information from [4mtimeptr[24m  into  the
       buffer [4mbuf[24m according to the string pointed to by [4mformat[24m.

       The  [4mformat[24m  string  consists of zero or more conversion specifications
       and ordinary characters.  All ordinary characters are  copied  directly
       into the buffer.  A conversion specification consists of a percent sign
       “‘%’” and one other character.

       No  more than [4mmaxsize[24m characters will be placed into the array.  If the
       total number of resulting characters, including  the  terminating  null
       character,  is  not more than [4mmaxsize[24m, [1mstrftime[22m() returns the number of
       characters in the array, not counting the terminating null.  Otherwise,
       zero is returned.

       Each conversion specification is replaced by the characters as  follows
       which are then copied into the buffer.

       [1m%A    [22mis replaced by the full weekday name.

       [1m%b or %h[0m
