       [1mstrtol[22m([4mchar[24m [4m*nptr[24m, [4mchar[24m [4m**endptr[24m, [4mint[24m [4mbase[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mstrtol[22m()  function converts the string in [4mnptr[24m to a [4mlong[24m value ac‐
       cording to the given [4mbase[24m, which must be between 2 and 36 inclusive, or
       be the special value 0.

       The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space (as deter‐
       mined by [4misspace[24m(3)) followed by a single optional ‘+’ or ‘‐’ sign.  If
       [4mbase[24m is zero or 16, the string may then include a ‘0x’ prefix, and  the
       number  will  be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero [4mbase[24m is taken as 10
       (decimal) unless the next character is ‘0’, in which case it  is  taken
       as 8 (octal).

       The remainder of the string is converted to a [4mlong[24m value in the obvious
       manner,  stopping  at the first character which is not a valid digit in
       the given base.  (In bases above 10, the letter ‘A’ in either upper  or
       lower  case  represents  10,  ‘B’ represents 11, and so forth, with ‘Z’
       representing 35.)

       If [4mendptr[24m is non nil, [1mstrtol[22m() stores the address of the first  invalid
       character  in  [4m*endptr[24m.   If  there  were  no  digits  at all, however,
       [1mstrtol[22m() stores the original value of [4mnptr[24m in [4m*endptr[24m.  (Thus, if [4m*nptr[0m
       is not ‘\0’ but [4m**endptr[24m is ‘\0’  on  return,  the  entire  string  was
       valid.)

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The  [1mstrtol[22m() function returns the result of the conversion, unless the
       value would underflow or overflow.  If an  underflow  occurs,  [1mstrtol[22m()
       returns  LONG_MIN.   If  an overflow occurs, [1mstrtol[22m() returns LONG_MAX.
       In both cases, [4merrno[24m is set to ERANGE.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [ERANGE]  The given string was out of range; the  value  converted  has
                 been clamped.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The [1mstrtol[22m() function conforms to ANSI X3.159‐1989 (“ANSI C89”).

[1mBUGS[0m
