[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mgethostbyname[22m() and [1mgethostbyaddr[22m() functions each return a pointer
       to an object with the following structure describing an  internet  host
       referenced  by  name  or by address, respectively.  This structure con‚Äê
       tains either the information obtained from the name  server,  [4mnamed[24m(8),
       or  broken‚Äêout  fields  from  a  line in [4m/etc/hosts[24m.  If the local name
       server is not running these routines do a lookup in [4m/etc/hosts[24m.

       struct  hostent {
               char    *h_name;        /* official name of host */
               char    **h_aliases;    /* alias list */
               int     h_addrtype;     /* host address type */
               int     h_length;       /* length of address */
               char    **h_addr_list;  /* list of addresses from name server */
       };
       #define h_addr  h_addr_list[0]  /* address, for backward compatibility */

       The members of this structure are:

       [4mh_name[24m       Official name of the host.

       [4mh_aliases[24m    A zero terminated array of alternate names for the host.

       [4mh_addrtype[24m   The type  of  address  being  returned;  currently  always
                    AF_INET.

       [4mh_length[24m     The length, in bytes, of the address.

       [4mh_addr_list[24m  A zero terminated array of network addresses for the host.
                    Host addresses are returned in network byte order.

       [4mh_addr[24m       The  first  address  in  [4mh_addr_list[24m; this is for backward
                    compatiblity.

                    When using the nameserver, [1mgethostbyname[22m() will search for
                    the named host in the current domain and its  parents  un‚Äê
                    less the name ends in a dot.  If the name contains no dot,
                    and if the environment variable ‚ÄúHOSTALIASES‚Äù contains the
                    name  of  an  alias  file,  the  alias  file will first be
                    searched for  an  alias  matching  the  input  name.   See
                    [4mhostname[24m(7)  for the domain search procedure and the alias
                    file format.

                    The [1msethostent[22m() function may be used to request  the  use
                    of  a  connected  TCP socket for queries.  If the [4mstayopen[0m
                    flag is non‚Äêzero, this sets the option to send all queries
                    to the name server using TCP and to retain the  connection
                    after  each  call  to  [1mgethostbyname[22m() or [1mgethostbyaddr[22m().
                    Otherwise, queries are performed using UDP datagrams.

                    The [1mendhostent[22m() function closes the TCP connection.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       Error return status from [1mgethostbyname[22m() and [1mgethostbyaddr[22m()  is  indi‚Äê
       cated  by  return  of a null pointer.  The external integer [4mh_errno[24m may
       then be checked to see whether this is a temporary failure  or  an  in‚Äê
       valid  or  unknown  host.  The routine [1mherror[22m() can be used to print an
       error message describing  the  failure.   If  its  argument  [4mstring[24m  is
       non‚ÄêNULL,  it  is  printed, followed by a colon and a space.  The error
       message is printed with a trailing newline.

       The variable [4mh_errno[24m can have the following values:

       HOST_NOT_FOUND  No such host is known.

       TRY_AGAIN       This is usually a temporary error and  means  that  the
                       local server did not receive a response from an author‚Äê
                       itative  server.   A  retry at some later time may suc‚Äê
                       ceed.

       NO_RECOVERY     Some unexpected server failure was  encountered.   This
                       is a non‚Äêrecoverable error.

       NO_DATA         The requested name is valid but does not have an IP ad‚Äê
                       dress;  this is not a temporary error.  This means that
                       the name is known to the name server but  there  is  no
                       address associated with this name.  Another type of re‚Äê
                       quest  to  the  name server using this domain name will
                       result in an answer; for example, a mail‚Äêforwarder  may
                       be registered for this domain.

[1mCAVEAT[0m
       The [1mgethostent[22m() function is defined, and [1msethostent[22m() and [1mendhostent[22m()
       are redefined, when [4mlibc[24m(3) is built to use only the routines to lookup
       in [4m/etc/hosts[24m and not the name server.

       The  [1mgethostent[22m()  function  reads the next line of [4m/etc/hosts[24m, opening
       the file if necessary.

       The [1msethostent[22m() function is redefined to open and rewind the file.  If
       the [4mstayopen[24m argument is non‚Äêzero, the hosts  data  base  will  not  be
       closed  after  each  call  to  [1mgethostbyname[22m() or [1mgethostbyaddr[22m().  The
       [1mendhostent[22m() function is redefined to close the file.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The  [1mherror[22m()  function  appeared   in   4.3BSD.    The   [1mendhostent[22m(),
       [1mgethostbyaddr[22m(),  [1mgethostbyname[22m(), [1mgethostent[22m(), and [1msethostent[22m() func‚Äê
       tions appeared in 4.2BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
       These functions use static data storage; if the data is needed for  fu‚Äê
       ture use, it should be copied before any subsequent calls overwrite it.
       Only the Internet address format is currently understood.
