[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mfree[22m()  function  causes the space pointed to by [4mptr[24m to be deallo‚Äê

       null  pointer,  no  action occurs.  Otherwise, if the argument does not
       match a pointer earlier returned by  the  [4mcalloc[24m,  [4mmalloc[24m,  or  [4mrealloc[0m
       function,  or  if the space has been deallocated by a call to [1mfree[22m() or
       [4mrealloc[24m, general havoc may occur.
