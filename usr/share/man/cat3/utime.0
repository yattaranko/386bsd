       [1mutime[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*file[24m, [4mconst[24m [4mstruct[24m [4mutimbuf[24m [4m*timep[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mutime[22m()  function  sets  the  access and modification times of the
       named file.

       If [4mtimep[24m is NULL, the access and modification times are set to the cur‚Äê
       rent time.  The calling process must be the owner of the file  or  have
       permission to write the file.

       If  [4mtimep[24m  is  non‚ÄêNULL,  [4mtime[24m  is assumed to be a pointer to a utimbuf
       structure, as defined in ‚ü®[4mutime.h[24m‚ü©:

             struct utimbuf {
                     time_t actime;          /* Access time */
                     time_t modtime;         /* Modification time */
             } ;

       The access time is set to the value of the actime member, and the modi‚Äê
       fication time is set to the value of the modtime member.  The times are
       measured in seconds since 0 hours, 0 minutes,  0  seconds,  January  1,
       1970,  Coordinated  Universal  Time.   The  calling process must be the
       owner of the file or be the super‚Äêuser.

       In either case, the inode‚Äêchange‚Äêtime of the file is set to the current
       time.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion, a value of 0  is  returned.   Otherwise,  a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mUtime[22m() will fail if:

       [EACCES]           Search  permission  is denied for a component of the
                          path prefix; or the [4mtimes[24m argument is NULL  and  the
                          effective  user ID of the process does not match the
                          owner of the file, and is not  the  super‚Äêuser,  and
                          write access is denied.

       [EFAULT]           [4mFile[24m or [4mtimes[24m points outside the process‚Äôs allocated
                          address space.

       [EINVAL]           The  pathname contains a character with the high‚Äêor‚Äê
                          der bit set.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while reading or  writing  the
                          affected inode.

       [ELOOP]            Too  many  symbolic links were encountered in trans‚Äê
                          lating the pathname.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     A component of a pathname exceeded  255  characters,
                          or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]           The named file does not exist.

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EPERM]            The  [4mtimes[24m  argument  is  not  NULL  and the calling
                          process‚Äôs effective user ID does not match the owner
                          of the file and is not the super‚Äêuser.

       [EROFS]            The file system containing the file is mounted read‚Äê
                          only.
