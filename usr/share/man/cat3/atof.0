[1mNAME[0m
       atof — convert ASCII string to double

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <stdlib.h>[0m

       [4mdouble[0m
       [1matof[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*nptr[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1matof[22m() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed
       to by [4mnptr[24m to [4mdouble[24m representation.

       It is equivalent to:

             strtod(nptr, (char **)NULL);

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The [1matof[22m() function conforms to ANSI X3.159‐1989 (“ANSI C89”).

[1mBUGS[0m
       This manual page represents intent instead of actual  practice.   While
       it is intended that [1matof[22m() be implemented using [4mstrtod[24m(3), this has not
       yet happened.  In the current system, [1matof[22m() translates a string in the
       following  form  to a double: a string of leading white space, possibly
       followed by a sign (‘‘+’’ or ‘‘‐’’), followed by a digit  string  which
       may  contain one decimal point (‘‘.’’), which may be followed by either
       of the exponent flags (‘‘E’’ or  ‘‘e’’),  and  lastly,  followed  by  a
       signed or unsigned integer.
