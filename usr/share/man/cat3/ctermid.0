[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <stdio.h>[0m

       [4mchar[24m [4m*[0m
       [1mctermid[22m([4mchar[24m [4m*buf[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mctermid[22m()  function generates a string, that, when used as a path‚Äê
       name, refers  to  the  current  controlling  terminal  of  the  calling
       process.

       If  [4mbuf[24m  is  the  NULL pointer, a pointer to a static area is returned.
       Otherwise, the pathname is copied into the memory  referenced  by  [4mbuf[24m.
       The argument [4mbuf[24m is assumed to be at least L_ctermid (as defined in the
       include file ‚ü®[4mstdio.h[24m‚ü©) bytes long.

       The current implementation simply returns ‚Äò/dev/tty‚Äô.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion, a non‚ÄêNULL pointer is returned.  Otherwise,
       a  NULL pointer is returned and the global variable [4merrno[24m is set to in‚Äê
       dicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The current implementation detects no error conditions.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The [4mctermid[24m function conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1‚Äê1988 (‚ÄúPOSIX.1‚Äù).

[1mBUGS[0m
       By default the [1mctermid[22m() function writes all information to an internal
       static object.  Subsequent calls to [1mctermid[22m() will modify the same  ob‚Äê
       ject.
