[1mSYNOPSIS[0m

       [1matanh[22m([4mdouble[24m [4mx[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1matanh[22m()  function  computes  the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the
       real argument [4mx[24m.  For a  discussion  of  error  due  to  roundoff,  see
       [4mmath[24m(3).

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The  [1matanh[22m()  function  returns  the inverse hyperbolic tangent of [4mx[24m if
       successful.  On the VAX and Tahoe, if the argument has  absolute  value
       bigger  than  or  equal to 1, [1matanh[22m() sets the global variable [4merrno[24m to
       EDOM and a reserved operand fault is generated.
