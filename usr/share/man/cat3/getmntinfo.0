       [1mgetmntinfo[22m([4mint[24m [4mmntbufp[24m, [4mint[24m [4mflags[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mgetmntinfo[22m()  function  returns  an array of [4mstatfs[24m structures de‚Äê
       scribing each currently mounted file system (see [4mstatfs[24m(2)).

       The [1mgetmntinfo[22m() function passes its [4mflags[24m parameter  transparently  to
       [4mgetfsstat[24m(2).

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       On successful completion, [1mgetmntinfo[22m() returns a count of the number of
       elements  in  the  array.   The  pointer  to  the  array is stored into
       [4mmntbufp[24m.

       If an error occurs, zero is returned and the external variable [4merrno[24m is
       set to indicate the error.  Although the pointer [4mmntbufp[24m will be unmod‚Äê
       ified, any information previously  returned  by  [1mgetmntinfo[22m()  will  be
       lost.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The  [1mgetmntinfo[22m() function may fail and set errno for any of the errors
       specified for the library routines [4mgetfsstat[24m(2) or [4mmalloc[24m(3).

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mgetmntinfo[22m() function is currently under development.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The [1mgetmntinfo[22m() function writes the array of structures to an internal
       static object and returns a pointer to that object. Subsequent calls to
       [1mgetmntinfo[22m() will modify the same object.

       The memory allocated by [1mgetmntinfo[22m() cannot be [4mfree[24m(2)‚Äôd by the  appli‚Äê
       cation.
