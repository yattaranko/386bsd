[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mopendir[22m()  function  opens  the directory named by [4mfilename[24m, asso‚Äê
       ciates a [4mdirectory[24m [4mstream[24m with it and returns a pointer to be  used  to
       identify  the  [4mdirectory[24m  [4mstream[24m in subsequent operations.  The pointer
       NULL is returned if [4mfilename[24m  cannot  be  accessed,  or  if  it  cannot
       [4mmalloc[24m(3) enough memory to hold the whole thing.

       The  [1mreaddir[22m()  function returns a pointer to the next directory entry.
       It returns NULL upon reaching the end of the directory or detecting  an
       invalid [1mseekdir[22m() operation.

       The [1mtelldir[22m() function returns the current location associated with the
       named [4mdirectory[24m [4mstream[24m.

       The  [1mseekdir[22m()  function sets the position of the next [1mreaddir[22m() opera‚Äê
       tion on the [4mdirectory[24m [4mstream[24m.  The new position reverts to the one  as‚Äê
       sociated  with  the  [4mdirectory[24m  [4mstream[24m when the [1mtelldir[22m() operation was
       performed.  Values returned by [1mtelldir[22m() are good only for the lifetime
       of the DIR pointer, [4mdirp[24m, from which they are derived.  If  the  direc‚Äê
       tory  is  closed  and then reopened, the [1mtelldir[22m() value may be invali‚Äê
       dated due to undetected directory compaction.  It is safe to use a pre‚Äê
       vious [1mtelldir[22m() value immediately after a call to [1mopendir[22m() and  before
       any calls to [1mreaddir[22m().

       The  [1mrewinddir[22m()  function  resets  the position of the named [4mdirectory[0m
       [4mstream[24m to the beginning of the directory.

       The [1mclosedir[22m() function closes the named [4mdirectory[24m [4mstream[24m and frees the
       structure associated with the [4mdirp[24m pointer, returning 0 on success.  On
       failure, -1 is returned and the global variable [4merrno[24m is set  to  indi‚Äê
       cate the error.

       The  [1mdirfd[22m()  function  returns  the integer file descriptor associated
       with the named [4mdirectory[24m [4mstream[24m, see [4mopen[24m(2).

       Sample code which searchs a directory for entry ‚Äò‚Äòname‚Äô‚Äô is:

             len = strlen(name);
             dirp = opendir(".");
             for (dp = readdir(dirp); dp != NULL; dp = readdir(dirp))
                     if (dp‚Äê>d_namlen == len && !strcmp(dp‚Äê>d_name, name)) {
                             (void)closedir(dirp);
                             return FOUND;
                     }
             (void)closedir(dirp);
             return NOT_FOUND;
