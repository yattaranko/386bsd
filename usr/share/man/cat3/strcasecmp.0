[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mstrcasecmp[22m()  and  [1mstrncasecmp[22m() functions compare the null‚Äêtermi‚Äê
       nated strings [4ms1[24m and [4ms2[24m and return an integer greater than,  equal  to,
       or  less  than  0,  according  as [4ms1[24m is lexicographically greater than,
       equal to, or less than [4ms2[24m after translation of each corresponding char‚Äê
       acter to lower‚Äêcase.  The strings themselves  are  not  modified.   The
       comparison is done using unsigned characters, so that ‚Äò[1m\200[22m‚Äô is greater
       than ‚Äò\0‚Äô.

       The [1mstrncasecmp[22m() compares at most [4mlen[24m characters.
