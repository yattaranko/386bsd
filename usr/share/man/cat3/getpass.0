[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mgetpass[22m()  function  displays a prompt to, and reads in a password
       from, [4m/dev/tty[24m.  If this file is not accessible, [1mgetpass  [22mdisplays  the
       prompt on the standard error output and reads from the standard input.

       The  password  may be up to _PASSWORD_LEN (currently 128) characters in
       length.  Any additional characters and the terminating newline  charac‚Äê
       ter are discarded.

       [1mGetpass [22mturns off character echoing while reading the password.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       [1mGetpass [22mreturns a pointer to the null terminated password.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       A [1mgetpass [22mfunction appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The [1mgetpass [22mfunction leaves its result in an internal static object and
       returns  a  pointer  to  that object.  Subsequent calls to [1mgetpass [22mwill
       modify the same object.

       The calling process should zero the password as  soon  as  possible  to
       avoid  leaving  the cleartext password visible in the process‚Äôs address
       space.
