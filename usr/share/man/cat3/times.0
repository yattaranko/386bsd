[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mThis interface is obsoleted by getrusage(2) and gettimeofday(3).[0m

       The [1mtimes[22m() function returns the value of time in CLK_TCK‚Äôs of a second
       since  0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, January 1, 1970, Coordinated Uni‚Äê
       versal Time.

       It also fills in the structure pointed to by  [4mtp[24m  with  time‚Äêaccounting
       information.

       The [4mtms[24m structure is defined as follows:

             typedef struct {
                     clock_t tms_utime;
                     clock_t tms_stime;
                     clock_t tms_cutime;
                     clock_t tms_cstime;
             }

       The elements of this structure are defined as follows:

       [4mtms_utime[24m   The  CPU  time  charged  for the execution of user instruc‚Äê
                   tions.

       [4mtms_stime[24m   The CPU time charged for execution by the system on  behalf
                   of the process.

       [4mtms_cutime[24m  The  sum  of  the [4mtms_utime[24m [4ms[24m and [4mtms_cutime[24m [4ms[24m of the child
                   processes.

       [4mtms_cstime[24m  The sum of the [4mtms_stime[24ms  and  [4mtms_cstime[24ms  of  the  child
                   processes.

       All times are in CLK_TCK‚Äôs of a second.

       The  times of a terminated child process are included in the [4mtms_cutime[0m
       and [4mtms_cstime[24m elements of the parent when one of the [4mwait[24m(2) functions
       returns the process ID of the terminated child to the  parent.   If  an
       error  occurs,  [1mtimes[22m() returns the value ((clock_t)-1), and sets errno
       to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The [1mtimes[22m() function may fail and set the global variable [4merrno[24m for any
       of the errors specified  for  the  library  routines  [4mgetrusage[24m(2)  and
       [4mgettimeofday[24m(2).

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The [1mtimes[22m() function conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1‚Äê1988 (‚ÄúPOSIX.1‚Äù).
