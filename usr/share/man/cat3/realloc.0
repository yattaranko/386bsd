[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mrealloc[22m() function changes the size of the object pointed to by [4mptr[0m
       to  the  size  specified  by  [4msize[24m.  The contents of the object are un‚Äê
       changed up to the lesser of the new and old sizes.  If the new size  is
       larger, the value of the newly allocated portion of the object is inde‚Äê
       terminate.   If  [4mptr[24m  is a null pointer, the [1mrealloc[22m() function behaves
       like the [4mmalloc[24m(3) function for the specified size.  Otherwise, if  [4mptr[0m
       does  not match a pointer earlier returned by the [4mcalloc[24m(3), [4mmalloc[24m(3),
       or [1mrealloc[22m() function, or if the space has been deallocated by  a  call
       to  the [4mfree[24m or [1mrealloc[22m() function, unpredictable and usually detrimen‚Äê
       tal behaviour will occur.  If the space cannot be allocated, the object
       pointed to by [4mptr[24m is unchanged.  If [4msize[24m is zero and [4mptr[24m is not a  null
       pointer, the object it points to is freed.

       The  [1mrealloc[22m()  function  returns either a null pointer or a pointer to
       the possibly moved allocated space.
