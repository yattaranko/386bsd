[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       These functions calculate the error function of [4mx[24m.

       The [1merf[22m() calculates the error function of x; where

             erf(x) = 2/sqrt(pi)âˆ—integral from 0 to x of exp(-tâˆ—t) dt.

       The  [1merfc[22m()  function calculates the complementary error function of [4mx[24m;
       that is [1merfc[22m() subtracts the result of the error function  [1merf[22m([4mx[24m)  from
       1.0.  This is useful, since for large [4mx[24m places disappear.
