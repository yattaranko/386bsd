       It  is implemented by calling [4mmalloc[24m(3) with a slightly larger request,
       saving the true beginning of the block allocated, and returning a prop‚Äê
       erly aligned pointer.

       The [1mvalloc[22m() function returns a pointer to the allocated space if  suc‚Äê
       cessful; otherwise a null pointer is returned

       The [1mvalloc[22m() function appeared in 3.0BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
       A [4mvfree[24m function has not been implemented.
