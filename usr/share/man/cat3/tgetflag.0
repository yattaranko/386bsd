[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       These functions extract and use capabilities from a terminal capability
       data base, usually [4m/usr/share/misc/termcap[24m, the format of which is  de‚Äê
       scribed in [4mtermcap[24m(5).  These are low level routines; see [4mcurses[24m(3) for
       a higher level package.

       The  [1mtgetent[22m()  function  extracts the entry for terminal [4mname[24m into the
       buffer at [4mbp[24m.  The [4mbp[24m argument should be a  character  buffer  of  size
       1024  and  must  be retained through all subsequent calls to [1mtgetnum[22m(),
       [1mtgetflag[22m(), and [1mtgetstr[22m().  The [1mtgetent[22m() function returns -1  if  none
       of  the [1mtermcap [22mdata base files could be opened, 0 if the terminal name
       given does not have an entry, and 1 if all goes well.  It will look  in
       the  environment  for a TERMCAP variable.  If found, and the value does
       not begin with a slash, and the terminal type [4mname[24m is the same  as  the
       environment  string TERM, the TERMCAP string is used instead of reading
       a [1mtermcap [22mfile.  If it does begin with a slash, the string is used as a
       path name of the [1mtermcap [22mfile to search.  If  TERMCAP  does  not  begin
       with  a  slash  and [4mname[24m is different from TERM, [1mtgetent[22m() searches the
       files [4m$HOME/.termcap[24m and [4m/usr/share/misc/termcap[24m, in that order, unless
       the environment variable TERMPATH exists, in which case it specifies  a
       list  of  file pathnames (separated by spaces or colons) to be searched
       instead.  Whenever multiple files are searched and a [1mtc [22mfield occurs in
       the requested entry, the entry it names must be found in the same  file
       or  one of the succeeding files.  This can speed up entry into programs
       that call [1mtgetent[22m(), as well as help debug new terminal descriptions or
       make  one  for  your   terminal   if   you   can‚Äôt   write   the   file
       [4m/usr/share/misc/termcap[24m.

       The [1mtgetnum[22m() function gets the numeric value of capability [4mid[24m, return‚Äê
       ing  -1  if is not given for the terminal.  The [1mtgetflag[22m() function re‚Äê
       turns 1 if the specified capability is present in the terminal‚Äôs entry,
       0 if it is not.  The [1mtgetstr[22m() function returns the string value of the
       capability [4mid[24m, places it in the buffer at [4marea[24m, and advances  the  [4marea[0m
       pointer.   It  decodes  the  abbreviations  for this field described in
       [4mtermcap[24m(5), except for cursor addressing and padding information.   The
       [1mtgetstr[22m() function returns NULL if the capability was not found.

       The [1mtgoto[22m() function returns a cursor addressing string decoded from [4mcm[0m
       to  go  to column [4mdestcol[24m in line [4mdestline[24m.  It uses the external vari‚Äê
       ables [4mUP[24m (from the [1mup [22mcapability) and [4mBC[24m (if [1mbc [22mis  given  rather  than
       [1mbs[22m)  if necessary to avoid placing [1m\n[22m, [1mÀÜD [22mor [1mÀÜ@ [22min the returned string.
       (Programs which call [1mtgoto[22m() should be  sure  to  turn  off  the  XTABS
       bit(s),  since  [1mtgoto[22m() may now output a tab.  Note that programs using
       termcap should in general turn off XTABS anyway  since  some  terminals
       use control‚ÄêI for other functions, such as nondestructive space.)  If a
       [1m%  [22msequence  is  given  which  is  not understood, then [1mtgoto[22m() returns
       (OOPS).

       The [1mtputs[22m() function decodes the leading  padding  information  of  the
       string  [4mcp[24m; [4maffcnt[24m gives the number of lines affected by the operation,
       or 1 if this is not applicable, [4moutc[24m is a routine which is called  with
       each  character  in  turn.  The external variable [4mospeed[24m should contain
       the output speed of the terminal as encoded by [4mstty[24m(3).   The  external
       variable  [4mPC[24m  should contain a pad character to be used (from the capa‚Äê
       bility) if a null ([1mÀÜ@[22m) is inappropriate.
