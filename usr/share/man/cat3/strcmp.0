[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mstrcmp[22m()  and  [1mstrncmp[22m()  functions  lexicographically compare the
       null‚Äêterminated strings [4ms1[24m and [4ms2[24m.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The [1mstrcmp[22m() and [1mstrncmp[22m() return an integer greater than, equal to, or
       less than 0, according as the string [4ms1[24m is greater than, equal  to,  or
       less than the string [4ms2[24m.  The comparison is done using unsigned charac‚Äê
       ters, so that ‚Äò\200‚Äô is greater than ‚Äò\0‚Äô.

       The [1mstrncmp[22m() compares not more than [4mlen[24m characters.
