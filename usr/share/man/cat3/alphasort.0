[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mscandir[22m() function reads the directory [4mdirname[24m and builds an array
       of pointers to directory entries using [4mmalloc[24m(3).  It returns the  num‚Äê
       ber  of  entries in the array.  A pointer to the array of directory en‚Äê
       tries is stored in the location referenced by [4mnamelist[24m.

       The [4mselect[24m parameter is a pointer to a user supplied  subroutine  which
       is  called  by  [1mscandir[22m() to select which entries are to be included in
       the array.  The select routine is passed a pointer to a directory entry
       and should return a non‚Äêzero value if the directory entry is to be  in‚Äê
       cluded in the array.  If [4mselect[24m is null, then all the directory entries
       will be included.

       The  [4mcompar[24m  parameter is a pointer to a user supplied subroutine which
       is passed to [4mqsort[24m(3) to sort the completed array.  If this pointer  is
       null, the array is not sorted.

       The  [1malphasort[22m() function is a routine which can be used for the [4mcompar[0m
       parameter to sort the array alphabetically.

       The memory allocated for the array can be deallocated with [4mfree[24m(3),  by
       freeing each pointer in the array and then the array itself.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       Returns  -1  if  the  directory  cannot  be  opened  for  reading or if
       [4mmalloc[24m(3) cannot allocate enough memory to hold  all  the  data  struc‚Äê
       tures.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mscandir[22m() and [1malphasort[22m() functions appeared in 4.2BSD.
