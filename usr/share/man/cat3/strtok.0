[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mThis interface is obsoleted by strsep(3).[0m

       The  [1mstrtok[22m()  function is used to isolate sequential tokens in a null‚Äê
       terminated string, [4mstr[24m.  These tokens are separated in the string by at
       least one of the characters in [4msep[24m.  The first time  that  [1mstrtok[22m()  is
       called,  [4mstr[24m  should  be specified; subsequent calls, wishing to obtain
       further tokens from the same string, should pass  a  null  pointer  in‚Äê
       stead.   The separator string, [4msep[24m, must be supplied each time, and may
       change between calls.

       The [1mstrtok[22m() function returns a pointer to the beginning of each subse‚Äê
       quent token in the string, after replacing the token itself with a  NUL
       character.  When no more tokens remain, a null pointer is returned.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The [1mstrtok[22m() function conforms to ANSI X3.159‚Äê1989 (‚ÄúANSI C89‚Äù).

[1mBUGS[0m
       There is no way to get tokens from multiple strings simultaneously.

       The System V [1mstrtok[22m(), if handed a  string  containing  only  delimiter
       characters,  will  not alter the next starting point, so that a call to
       [1mstrtok[22m() with a different (or empty)  delimiter  string  may  return  a
       non‚ÄêNULL  value.   Since  this  implementation  always  alters the next
       starting point, such a sequence of calls would always return NULL.
