[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mbsearch[22m() function searches an array of [4mnmemb[24m objects,  the  inital
       member  of  which  is pointed to by [4mbase[24m, for a member that matches the
       object pointed to by [4mkey[24m.  The size of each  member  of  the  array  is
       specified by [4msize[24m.

       The contents of the array should be in ascending sorted order according
       to the comparison function referenced by [4mcompar[24m.  The [4mcompar[24m routine is
       expected to have two two arguments which point to the [4mkey[24m object and to
       an array member, in that order, and should return an integer less than,
       equal  to,  or  greater  than  zero if the [4mkey[24m object is found, respec‚Äê
       tively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the array member.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The [1mbsearch[22m() function returns a pointer to a matching  member  of  the
       array,  or a null pointer if no match is found.  If two members compare
       as equal, which member is matched is unspecified.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The [1mbsearch[22m() function conforms to ANSI X3.159‚Äê1989 (‚ÄúANSI C89‚Äù).
