[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mexec [22mfamily of functions replaces the current process image with a
       new process image.  The functions described in  this  manual  page  are
       front‚Äêends for the function [4mexecve[24m(2).  (See the manual page for [4mexecve[0m
       for detailed information about the replacement of the current process.)

       The  initial  argument  for  these  functions is the pathname of a file
       which is to be executed.

       The [4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*arg[24m and subsequent ellipses in the  [1mexecl[22m(),  [1mexeclp[22m(),
       and [1mexecle[22m() functions can be thought of as [4marg0[24m, [4marg1[24m, ..., [4margn[24m.  To‚Äê
       gether  they describe a list of one or more pointers to null‚Äêterminated
       strings that represent the argument list available to the executed pro‚Äê
       gram.  The first argument, by convention, should point to the file name
       associated with the file being executed.  The list of arguments [4mmust[24m be
       terminated by a NULL pointer.

       The [1mexect[22m(), [1mexecv[22m(), and [1mexecvp[22m() functions provide an array of point‚Äê
       ers to null‚Äêterminated strings that represent the argument list  avail‚Äê
       able  to  the  new  program.  The first argument, by convention, should
       point to the file name associated with the file  begin  executed.   The
       array of pointers [1mmust [22mbe terminated by a NULL pointer.

       The  [1mexecle[22m() and [1mexect[22m() functions also specify the environment of the
       executed process by following the NULL pointer that terminates the list
       of arguments in the parameter list or the pointer  to  the  argv  array
       with an additional parameter.  This additional parameter is an array of
       pointers  to  null‚Äêterminated  strings and [4mmust[24m be terminated by a NULL
       pointer.  The other functions take the environment for the new  process
       image from the external variable [4menviron[24m in the current process.

       Some of these functions have special semantics.

       The  functions  [1mexeclp[22m() and [1mexecvp[22m() will duplicate the actions of the
       shell in searching for an executable file if the  specified  file  name
       does  not  contain  a slash ‚Äú[1m/[22m‚Äù character.  The search path is the path
       specified in the environment by  ‚ÄúPATH‚Äù  variable.   If  this  variable
       isn‚Äôt  specified,  the  default  path ‚Äú/bin:/usr/bin:‚Äù is used.  In ad‚Äê
       dtion, certain errors are treated specially.

       If permission is denied for  a  file  (the  attempted  [4mexecve[24m  returned
       EACCES), these functions will continue searching the rest of the search
       path.   If  no  other file is found, however, they will return with the
       global variable [4merrno[24m set to EACCES.

       If the header of a file isn‚Äôt recognized (the attempted [4mexecve[24m returned
       ENOEXEC), these functions will execute the shell with the path  of  the
       file as its first argument.  (If this attempt fails, no further search‚Äê
       ing is done.)

       If the file is currently busy (the attempted [4mexecve[24m returned ETXTBUSY),
       these  functions  will  sleep  for several seconds, periodically re‚Äêat‚Äê
       tempting to execute the file.

       The function [1mexect[22m() executes a file with the program  tracing  facili‚Äê
       ties enabled (see [4mptrace[24m(2)).

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       If any of the [4mexec[24m functions returns, an error will have occurred.  The
       return  value is -1, and the global variable [4merrno[24m will be set to indi‚Äê
       cate the error.

[1mFILES[0m

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mExecl[22m(), [1mexecle[22m(), [1mexeclp[22m() and [1mexecvp[22m() may fail and set [4merrno[24m for any
       of the  errors  specified  for  the  library  functions  [4mexecve[24m(2)  and
       [4mmalloc[24m(3).

       [1mExect[22m() and [1mexecv[22m() may fail and set [4merrno[24m for any of the errors speci‚Äê
       fied for the library function [4mexecve[24m(2).

[1mCOMPATIBILITY[0m
       Historically,  the default path for the [1mexeclp[22m() and [1mexecvp[22m() functions
       was ‚Äú[4m:/bin:/usr/bin[24m‚Äù.  This was changed to place the current  directory
       last to enhance system security.

       The  behavior of [1mexeclp[22m() and [1mexecvp[22m() when errors occur while attempt‚Äê
       ing to execute the file is historic practice, but has not traditionally
       been documented and is not specified by the POSIX standard.

       Traditionally, the functions [1mexeclp[22m() and [1mexecvp[22m() ignored  all  errors
       except  for  the  ones described above and ENOMEM and E2BIG, upon which
       they returned.  They now return if any error other than  the  ones  de‚Äê
       scribed above occurs.

       1003.1‚Äê1988 (‚ÄúPOSIX.1‚Äù).
