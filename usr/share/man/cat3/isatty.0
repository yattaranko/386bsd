[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       These functions operate on the system  file  descriptors  for  terminal
       type  devices.  These  descriptors  are not related to the standard I/O
       FILE typedef, but refer to the special device files found in  [4m/dev[24m  and
       named  [4m/dev/ttyxx[24m  and  for which an entry exists in the initialization
       file [4m/etc/ttys.[24m (See [4mttys[24m(5).)

       The [1misatty[22m() function determines if the file descriptor [4mfd[24m refers to  a
       valid terminal type device.

       The  [1mttyname[22m() function gets the related device name of a file descrip‚Äê
       tor for which [1misatty[22m() is true

       The [1mttyslot[22m() function fetches the current  process‚Äô  control  terminal
       number from the [4mttys[24m(5) file entry.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The  [1mttyname[22m()  function returns the null terminated name if the device
       is found and [1misatty[22m() is true; otherwise a NULL pointer is returned.

       The [1mttyslot[22m() function returns the unit number of the  device  file  if
       found; otherwise the value zero is returned.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       A  [1misatty[22m(),  [1mttyname[22m(),  and  [1mttyslot[22m() function appeared in Version 7
       AT&T UNIX.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The [1mttyname[22m() function leaves its result in an internal  static  object
       and  returns  a  pointer  to that object. Subsequent calls to [1mttyname[22m()
       will modify the same object.
