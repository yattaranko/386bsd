[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <stdlib.h>[0m

       [4mdouble[0m
       [1mstrtod[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*nptr[24m, [4mchar[24m [4m**endptr[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mstrtod[22m()  function  converts  the  initial  portion  of the string
       pointed to by [4mnptr[24m to [4mdouble[24m representation.

       The expected form of the string is an optional plus  (‚Äò‚Äò+‚Äô‚Äô)  or  minus
       sign  (‚Äò‚Äò‚Äê‚Äô‚Äô)  followed by a sequence of digits optionally containing a
       decimal‚Äêpoint character, optionally followed by an exponent.  An  expo‚Äê
       nent consists of an ‚Äò‚ÄòE‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äòe‚Äô‚Äô, followed by an optional plus or mi‚Äê
       nus sign, followed by a sequence of digits.

       Leading  white‚Äêspace  characters  in  the  string  (as  defined  by the
       [4misspace[24m(3) function) are skipped.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The [1mstrtod[22m() function returns the converted value, if any.

       If [4mendptr[24m is not NULL, a pointer to the character after the last  char‚Äê
       acter  used  in  the conversion is stored in the location referenced by
       [4mendptr[24m.

       If no conversion is performed, zero is returned and the value  of  [4mnptr[0m
       is stored in the location referenced by [4mendptr[24m.

       If  the  correct  value would cause overflow, plus or minus HUGE_VAL is
       returned (according to the sign of the value), and ERANGE is stored  in
       [4merrno[24m.   If  the  correct value would cause underflow, zero is returned
       and ERANGE is stored in [4merrno[24m.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [ERANGE]  Overflow or underflow occurred.
