[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <time.h>[0m

       [4mvoid[0m
       [1mtzset[22m([4mvoid[24m);

       [4mvoid[0m
       [1mtzsetwall[22m([4mvoid[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mtzset[22m()  function  initializes time conversion information used by
       the library routine [4mlocaltime[24m(3).  The environment variable  TZ  speci‚Äê
       fies how this is done.

       If TZ does not appear in the environment, the best available approxima‚Äê
       tion  to  local  wall  clock time, as specified by the [4mtzfile[24m(5)‚Äêformat
       file [4m/etc/localtime[24m is used.

       If TZ appears in the environment but its value is a null string,  Coor‚Äê
       dinated Universal Time (UTC) is used (without leap second correction).

       If  TZ  appears  in  the  environment and its value begins with a colon
       (‚Äò‚Äô):,  the  rest  of  its  value  is  used  as   a   pathname   of   a
       [4mtzfile[24m(5)‚Äêformat  file  from which to read the time conversion informa‚Äê
       tion.  If the first character of the pathname is a slash  (‚Äò/‚Äô)  it  is
       used as an absolute pathname; otherwise, it is used as a pathname rela‚Äê
       tive to the system time conversion information directory.

       If its value does not begin with a colon, it is first used as the path‚Äê
       name of a file (as described above) from which to read the time conver‚Äê
       sion  information.   If that file cannot be read, the value is then in‚Äê
       terpreted as a direct specification (the format is described below)  of
       the time conversion information.

       If the TZ environment variable does not specify a [4mtzfile[24m(5)‚Äêformat file
       and cannot be interpreted as a direct specification, UTC is used.

       The  [1mtzsetwall[22m()  function sets things up so that [4mlocaltime[24m returns the
       best available approximation of local wall clock time.

[1mSPECIFICATION FORMAT[0m
       When TZ is used directly as a specification of the time conversion  in‚Äê
       formation, it must have the following syntax (spaces inserted for clar‚Äê
       ity):

             [4mstd[24m [4moffset[24m [[4mdst[24m [[4moffset[24m] [, [4mrule[24m]]

       Where:

             [4mstd[24m and [4mdst[24m  Three or more bytes that are the designation for the
                          standard  ([4mstd[24m) or summer ([4mdst[24m) time zone.  Only [4mstd[0m
                          is required; if [4mdst[24m is  missing,  then  summer  time
                          does  not apply in this locale.  Upper and lowercase
                          letters are explicitly allowed.  Any characters  ex‚Äê
                          cept a leading colon (‚Äò‚Äô):, digits, comma (‚Äò,‚Äô), mi‚Äê
                          nus (‚Äò-‚Äô), plus (‚Äò+‚Äô), and ASCII NUL are allowed.

             [4moffset[24m       Indicates  the  value one must add to the local time
                          to arrive at Coordinated Universal Time.  The [4moffset[0m
                          has the form:

                                [4mhh[24m [:[4mmm[0m
                                [:[4mss[24m]]

                          The minutes ([4mmm[24m) and seconds ([4mss[24m) are optional.  The
                          hour ([4mhh[24m) is required and may  be  a  single  digit.
                          The  [4moffset[24m following [4mstd[24m is required.  If no [4moffset[0m
                          follows [4mdst[24m, summer time is assumed to be  one  hour
                          ahead  of  standard time.  One or more digits may be
                          used; the value is always interpreted as  a  decimal
                          number.   The  hour must be between zero and 24, and
                          the minutes (and seconds) ‚Äî  if  present  ‚Äî  between
                          zero  and  59.  If preceded by a (‚Äò-‚Äô) the time zone
                          shall be east of the Prime  Meridian;  otherwise  it
                          shall be west (which may be indicated by an optional
                          preceding (‚Äò+‚Äô)).

             [4mrule[24m         Indicates  when  to  change  to and back from summer
                          time.  The [4mrule[24m has the form:

                                [4mdate/time,date/time[0m

                          where the first [4mdate[24m describes when the change  from
                          standard  to  summer time occurs and the second [4mdate[0m
                          describes when the change back happens.   Each  [4mtime[0m
                          field  describes  when,  in  current local time, the
                          change to the other time is made.

                          The format of [4mdate[24m is one of the following:

                          [1mJ [4m[22mn[24m      The Julian day [4mn[24m (1 ‚â§ [4mn[24m ‚â§ 365).  Leap  days
                                   are  not  counted;  that is, in all years ‚Äî
                                   including leap years ‚Äî February 28  is  day
                                   59 and March 1 is day 60.  It is impossible
                                   to  explicitly refer to the occasional Feb‚Äê
                                   ruary 29.

                          [4mn[24m        The zero‚Äêbased Julian day (0 ‚â§ [4mn[24m ‚â§ 365 )  .
                                   Leap  days  are counted, and it is possible
                                   to refer to February 29.

                          [1mM [4m[22mm.n.d[24m  The [4md[24m‚Äôth day (0 ‚â§ [4md[24m ‚â§ 6  )  of  week  [4mn[24m  of
                                   month  [4mm[24m  of the year (1 ‚â§ [4mn[24m ‚â§ 5), (1 ‚â§ [4mm[24m ‚â§
                                   12), where week 5 means ‚Äúthe last [4md[24m day  in
                                   month  [4mm[24m‚Äù  which  may  occur  in either the
                                   fourth or the fifth week).  Week 1  is  the
                                   first  week  in  which the [4md[24m‚Äôth day occurs.
                                   Day zero is Sunday.

                                   The [4mtime[24m has the same format as [4moffset[24m  ex‚Äê
                                   cept that no leading sign (‚Äò-‚Äô) or (‚Äò+‚Äô) is
                                   allowed.   The  default,  if  [4mtime[24m  is  not
                                   given, is [1m02:00:00[22m.

                          If no [4mrule[24m is present in the TZ  specification,  the
                          rules   specified   by   the  [4mtzfile[24m(5)‚Äêformat  file
                          [4mposixrules[24m in the system time conversion information
                          directory are used, with  the  standard  and  summer
                          time offsets from UTC replaced by those specified by
                          the [4moffset[24m values in TZ.

       For  compatibility  with System V Release 3.1, a semicolon (‚Äò‚Äô); may be
       used to separate the [4mrule[24m from the rest of the specification.
