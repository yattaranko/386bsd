[1mNAME[0m
       lgamma ‚Äî log gamma function

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <math.h>[0m

       [4mdouble[0m
       [1mlgamma[22m([4mdouble[24m [4mx[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Lgamma returns ln|Œì(x)|.

       The external integer
       [4msigngam[0m
       returns the sign of
       Œì(x) .

[1mIDIOSYNCRASIES[0m
       Do  [4mnot[24m  use  the  expression  ‚Äú[1msigngam‚àóexp(lgamma(x))[22m‚Äù to compute g :=
       Œì(x).  Instead use a program like this (in C):

             lg = lgamma(x); g = signgam‚àóexp(lg);

       Only after [1mlgamma[22m() has returned can signgam be correct.  Note too that
       Œì(x) must overflow when x is large enough, underflow when -x  is  large
       enough, and spawn a division by zero when x is a nonpositive integer.

       Only in the UNIX math library for C was the name gamma ever attached to
       lnŒì.   Elsewhere, for instance in IBM‚Äôs FORTRAN library, the name GAMMA
       belongs to Œì and the name ALGAMA to lnŒì in single precision; in  double
       the names are DGAMMA and DLGAMA.  Why should C be different?

       Archaeological  records  suggest  that  C‚Äôs  [4mgamma[24m originally delivered
       ln(Œì(|x|)).  Later, the program gamma was changed to cope with negative
       arguments x in a more conventional way, but the documentation  did  not
       reflect that change correctly.  The most recent change corrects inaccu‚Äê
       rate  values when x is almost a negative integer, and lets Œì(x) be com‚Äê
       puted without conditional expressions.  Programmers should  not  assume
       that [1mlgamma[22m() has settled down.

       At  some  time  in the future, the name [4mgamma[24m will be rehabilitated and
       used for the gamma function, just as is done in  FORTRAN.   The  reason
       for  this  is  not  so  much  compatibility with FORTRAN as a desire to
       achieve greater speed for smaller values of |x|  and  greater  accuracy
       for larger values.

       Meanwhile,  programmers  who  have  to use the name [4mgamma[24m in its former
       sense, for what is now [1mlgamma[22m(), have two choices:

       1.      Use the old math library, [4mlibom[24m.

       2.      Add the following program to your others:

                     #include <math.h>
                     double gamma(x)
                     double x;
                     {
                             return (lgamma(x));
                     }

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       The reserved operand is returned on a VAX for  negative  integer  argu‚Äê
       ments, [4merrno[24m is set to ERANGE; for very large arguments over/underflows
       will occur inside the [1mlgamma[22m() routine.
