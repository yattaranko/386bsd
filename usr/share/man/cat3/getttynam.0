[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mgetttyent[22m(), and [1mgetttynam[22m() functions each return a pointer to an
       object, with the following structure, containing the broken‚Äêout  fields
       of a line from the tty description file.

       struct ttyent {
               char    *ty_name;       /* terminal device name */
               char    *ty_getty;      /* command to execute */
               char    *ty_type;       /* terminal type */
       #define TTY_ON          0x01    /* enable logins */
       #define TTY_SECURE      0x02    /* allow uid of 0 to login */
               int     ty_status;      /* flag values */
               char    *ty_window;     /* command for window manager */
               char    *ty_comment;    /* comment field */
       };

       The fields are as follows:

       [4mty_name[24m     The name of the character‚Äêspecial file.

       [4mty_getty[24m    The  name  of  the command invoked by [4minit[24m(8) to initialize
                   tty line characteristics.

       [4mty_type[24m     The name of the default terminal type connected to this tty
                   line.

       [4mty_status[24m   A mask of bit fields which indicate various actions allowed
                   on this tty line.  The possible flags are as follows:

                   TTY_ON      Enables logins (i.e., [4minit[24m(8)  will  start  the
                               command referenced by [4mty_getty[24m on this entry).

                   TTY_SECURE  Allow  users  with  a uid of 0 to login on this
                               terminal.

       [4mty_window[24m   The command to execute for a window system associated  with
                   the line.

       [4mty_comment[24m  Any  trailing  comment  field,  with any leading hash marks
                   (‚Äò‚Äò#‚Äô‚Äô) or whitespace removed.

       If any of the fields pointing to  character  strings  are  unspecified,
       they  are  returned as null pointers.  The field [4mty_status[24m will be zero
       if no flag values are specified.

       See [4mttys[24m(5) for a more complete discussion of the meaning and usage  of
       the fields.

       The  [1mgetttyent[22m() function reads the next line from the ttys file, open‚Äê
       ing the file if necessary.  The [1msetttyent[22m() function rewinds  the  file
       if open, or opens the file if it is unopened.  The [1mendttyent[22m() function
       closes any open files.

       The  [1mgetttynam[22m() function searches from the beginning of the file until
       a matching [4mname[24m is found (or until EOF is encountered).

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The routines [1mgetttyent[22m() and [1mgetttynam[22m() return a null pointer  on  EOF
       or error.  The [1msetttyent[22m() function and [1mendttyent[22m() return 0 on failure
       and 1 on success.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mgetttyent[22m(), [1mgetttynam[22m(), [1msetttyent[22m(),  and  [1mendttyent[22m()  functions
       appeared in 4.3BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
       These  functions use static data storage; if the data is needed for fu‚Äê
       ture use, it should be copied before any subsequent calls overwrite it.
