[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1minsque[22m()  and  [1mremque[22m()  manipulate  queues built from circular, doubly
       linked lists. Each element in the  queue  must  begin  with  a  "struct
       qelem".   [1minsque[22m()  inserts  [4mentry[24m in the queue immediately after [4mpred[24m.
       [1mremque[22m() removes [4mentry[24m from the queue.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       These functions are not atomic unless that machine architecture  allows
       it.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       These are derived from the insque and remque instructions on a VAX.
