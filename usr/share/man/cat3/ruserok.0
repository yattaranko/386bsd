[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mrcmd[22m() function is used by the super‚Äêuser to execute a command on a
       remote machine using an authentication scheme based  on  reserved  port
       numbers.   The  [1mrresvport[22m()  function  returns a descriptor to a socket
       with an address in the privileged port space.  The  [1mruserok[22m()  function
       is  used  by  servers  to  authenticate clients requesting service with
       [1mrcmd[22m().  All three functions are present in the same file and are  used
       by the [4mrshd[24m(8) server (among others).

       The  [1mrcmd[22m()  function  looks up the host [4m*ahost[24m using [4mgethostbyname[24m(3),
       returning -1 if the host does not exist.  Otherwise [4m*ahost[24m  is  set  to
       the  standard  name  of  the  host and a connection is established to a
       server residing at the well‚Äêknown Internet port [4minport[24m.

       If the connection succeeds, a socket in the  Internet  domain  of  type
       SOCK_STREAM  is returned to the caller, and given to the remote command
       as [4mstdin[24m and [4mstdout[24m.  If [4mfd2p[24m is non‚Äêzero, then an auxiliary channel to
       a control process will be set up, and  a  descriptor  for  it  will  be
       placed  in  [4m*fd2p[24m.   The  control process will return diagnostic output
       from the command (unit 2) on this channel, and will also  accept  bytes
       on  this  channel  as being UNIX signal numbers, to be forwarded to the
       process group of the command.  If [4mfd2p[24m is 0, then the [4mstderr[24m (unit 2 of
       the remote command) will be made the same as the [4mstdout[24m and  no  provi‚Äê
       sion  is  made for sending arbitrary signals to the remote process, al‚Äê
       though you may be able to get its attention by using out‚Äêof‚Äêband data.

       The protocol is described in detail in [4mrshd[24m(8).

       The [1mrresvport[22m() function is used to obtain a socket with  a  privileged
       address  bound  to  it.   This socket is suitable for use by [1mrcmd[22m() and
       several other functions.  Privileged Internet ports are  those  in  the
       range  0 to 1023.  Only the super‚Äêuser is allowed to bind an address of
       this sort to a socket.

       The [1mruserok[22m() argument takes a remote host‚Äôs name, as returned  by  the
       [4mgethostbyaddr[24m(3)  routine, two user names and a flag indicating whether
       the local user‚Äôs name is that of the super‚Äêuser.  Then, if the user  is
       [4mNOT[24m  the  super‚Äêuser,  it  checks  the files [4m/etc/hosts.equiv[24m.  If that
       lookup is not done, or is unsuccessful, the [4m.rhosts[24m in the local user‚Äôs
       home directory is checked to see if the request for service is allowed.
       If this file is owned by anyone other than the user or the  super‚Äêuser,
       or  if  it is writeable by anyone other than the owner, the check auto‚Äê
       matically fails.  A 0 is returned if the machine name is listed in  the
       ‚Äú[4mhosts.equiv[24m‚Äù  file,  or the host and remote user name are found in the
       ‚Äú[4m.rhosts[24m‚Äù file; otherwise [1mruserok[22m() returns -1.  If  the  local  domain
       (as  obtained  from  [4mgethostname[24m(2))  is the same as the remote domain,
       only the machine name need be specified.

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       The [1mrcmd[22m() function returns a valid socket descriptor on  success.   It
       returns -1 on error and prints a diagnostic message on the standard er‚Äê
       ror.

       The  [1mrresvport[22m()  function  returns a valid, bound socket descriptor on
       success.  It returns -1 on error with the global value  [4merrno[24m  set  ac‚Äê
       cording to the reason for failure.  The error code EAGAIN is overloaded
       to mean ‚Äò‚ÄòAll network ports in use.‚Äô‚Äô
