SLEEP(3)                    Library Functions Manual                  SLEEP(3)

[1mNAME[0m
       sleep ‚Äî suspend process execution for interval of seconds

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1msleep[22m([4mu_int[24m [4mseconds[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1msleep[22m()  function  suspends  execution  of the calling process for
       [4mseconds[24m of time.  System activity or time spent in processing the  call
       may lengthen the sleep by a second.

       If  a  timer  is already running on the process its state is saved.  If
       the value [4mseconds[24m is more than or equal to the remaining clock time for
       the saved timer, the sleep time is set to  the  remaining  clock  time.
       The state of the previous timer is restored after [4mseconds[24m has passed.

       This function is implemented using [4msetitimer[24m(2); it requires eight sys‚Äê
       tem calls each time it is invoked.  A similar but less compatible func‚Äê
       tion can be obtained with a single [4mselect[24m(2); such a function would not
       restart  after  signals,  but  would  not  interfere with other uses of
       [4msetitimer[24m.
