[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The routines  [1minet_aton[22m(),  [1minet_addr[22m()  and  [1minet_network[22m()  interpret
       character  strings representing numbers expressed in the Internet stan‐
       dard ‘.’ notation.  The [1minet_aton[22m() routine  interprets  the  specified
       character  string  as an Internet address, placing the address into the
       structure provided.  It returns 1 if the string was successfully inter‐
       preted,  or  0  if  the  string  is  invalid.   The   [1minet_addr[22m()   and
       [1minet_network[22m()  functions  return  numbers suitable for use as Internet
       addresses and Internet  network  numbers,  respectively.   The  routine
       [1minet_ntoa[22m()  takes an Internet address and returns an ASCII string rep‐
       resenting the address in ‘.’  notation.   The  routine  [1minet_makeaddr[22m()
       takes  an  Internet network number and a local network address and con‐
       structs an Internet address from it.   The  routines  [1minet_netof[22m()  and
       [1minet_lnaof[22m() break apart Internet host addresses, returning the network
       number and local network address part, respectively.

       All  Internet  addresses  are  returned in network order (bytes ordered
       from left to right).  All network numbers and local address  parts  are
       returned as machine format integer values.

[1mINTERNET ADDRESSES[0m
       Values  specified  using  the  ‘.’  notation  take one of the following
       forms:

             a.b.c.d
             a.b.c
             a.b
             a

       When four parts are specified, each is interpreted as a  byte  of  data
       and  assigned, from left to right, to the four bytes of an Internet ad‐
       dress.  Note that when an Internet address is viewed as a 32‐bit  inte‐
       ger  quantity  on  the  VAX  the  bytes  referred  to  above  appear as
       “[1md.c.b.a[22m”.  That is, VAX bytes are ordered from right to left.

       When a three part address is specified, the last part is interpreted as
       a 16‐bit quantity and placed in the right‐most two bytes of the network
       address.  This makes the three part address format convenient for spec‐
       ifying Class B network addresses as “[1m128.net.host[22m”.

       When a two part address is supplied, the last part is interpreted as  a
       24‐bit quantity and placed in the right most three bytes of the network
       address.   This makes the two part address format convenient for speci‐
       fying Class A network addresses as “[1mnet.host[22m”.

       When only one part is given, the value is stored directly in  the  net‐
       work address without any byte rearrangement.

       All  numbers  supplied as “parts” in a ‘.’ notation may be decimal, oc‐
       tal, or hexadecimal, as specified in the C language (i.e., a leading 0x
       or 0X implies hexadecimal; otherwise, a leading 0 implies octal; other‐
       wise, the number is interpreted as decimal).

[1mDIAGNOSTICS[0m
       The constant INADDR_NONE is returned by [1minet_addr[22m() and  [1minet_network[22m()
       for malformed requests.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mgethostbyname[24m(3), [4mgetnetent[24m(3), [4mhosts[24m(5), [4mnetworks[24m(5),

[1mHISTORY[0m
       These functions appeared in 4.2BSD.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The  value  INADDR_NONE  (0xffffffff) is a valid broadcast address, but
       [1minet_addr[22m() cannot return that value without indicating  failure.   The
       newer [1minet_aton[22m() function does not share this problem.  The problem of
       host  byte  ordering  versus  network  byte ordering is confusing.  The
       string returned by [1minet_ntoa[22m() resides in a static memory area.

       Inet_addr should return a [4mstruct[24m [4min_addr[24m.
