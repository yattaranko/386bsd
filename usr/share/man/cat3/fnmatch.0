[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mfnmatch[22m() function matches patterns according to the rules used by
       the shell.  It checks the string specified by the  [4mstring[24m  argument  to
       see if it matches the pattern specified by the [4mpattern[24m argument.

       The  [4mflags[24m  argument modifies the interpretation of [4mpattern[24m and [4mstring[24m.
       The value of [4mflags[24m is the bitwise inclusive OR of any of the  following
       constants, which are defined in the include file [4mfnmatch.h[24m.

       FNM_NOESCAPE  Normally,  every occurrence of a backslash (‚Äò\‚Äô) followed
                     by a character in [4mpattern[24m is replaced by that  character.
                     This  is done to negate any special meaning for the char‚Äê
                     acter.  If the FNM_NOESCAPE  flag  is  set,  a  backslash
                     character is treated as an ordinary character.

       FNM_PATHNAME  Slash  characters in [4mstring[24m must be explicitly matched by
                     slashes in [4mpattern[24m.   If  this  flag  is  not  set,  then
                     slashes are treated as regular characters.

       FNM_PERIOD    Leading  periods  in  strings  match periods in patterns.
                     The definition of ‚Äò‚Äòleading‚Äô‚Äô is related to the  specifi‚Äê
                     cation of FNM_PATHNAME. A period is always ‚Äò‚Äòleading‚Äô‚Äô if
                     it  is  the  first character in [4mstring[24m.  Additionally, if
                     FNM_PATHNAME is set, a period is ‚Äò‚Äòleading‚Äô‚Äô if it  imme‚Äê
                     diately  follows  a  slash.   [4mThis[24m  [4mflag[24m [4mis[24m [4mnot[24m [4mcurrently[0m

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The [1mfnmatch[22m() function returns zero if [4mstring[24m matches the pattern spec‚Äê
       ified by [4mpattern[24m, otherwise, it returns the value FNM_NOMATCH.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mfnmatch[22m() function is currently under development.

[1mBUGS[0m
       Quotes and slashes in range patterns are not handled correctly by  this
       implementation.

       The FNM_PERIOD flag is not implemented.

       The pattern ‚Äò*‚Äô matches the empty string, even if FNM_PATHNAME is spec‚Äê
       ified.
