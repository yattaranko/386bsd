[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       These  routines are used for making, sending and interpreting query and
       reply messages with Internet domain name servers.

       Global configuration and state information that is used by the resolver
       routines is kept in the structure [4m_res[24m.  Most of the values  have  rea‚Äê
       sonable  defaults  and  can be ignored.  Options stored in [4m_res.options[0m
       are defined in [4mresolv.h[24m and are as follows.  Options are  stored  as  a
       simple bit mask containing the bitwise ‚Äò‚Äòor‚Äô‚Äô of the options enabled.

       RES_INIT      True  if  the initial name server address and default do‚Äê
                     main name are  initialized  (i.e.,  [1mres_init[22m()  has  been
                     called).

       RES_DEBUG     Print debugging messages.

       RES_AAONLY    Accept  authoritative  answers  only.   With this option,
                     [1mres_send[22m() should continue until it finds  an  authorita‚Äê
                     tive answer or finds an error.  Currently this is not im‚Äê
                     plemented.

       RES_USEVC     Use TCP connections for queries instead of UDP datagrams.

       RES_STAYOPEN  Used  with  RES_USEVC to keep the TCP connection open be‚Äê
                     tween queries.  This is useful only in programs that reg‚Äê
                     ularly do many queries.  UDP should be  the  normal  mode
                     used.

       RES_IGNTC     Unused  currently  (ignore truncation errors, i.e., don‚Äôt
                     retry with TCP).

       RES_RECURSE   Set the recursion‚Äêdesired bit in queries.   This  is  the
                     default.   ([1mres_send[22m()  does not do iterative queries and
                     expects the name server to handle recursion.)

       RES_DEFNAMES  If set, [1mres_search[22m() will append the default domain  name
                     to  single‚Äêcomponent  names  (those that do not contain a
                     dot).  This option is enabled by default.

       RES_DNSRCH    If this option is set, [1mres_search[22m() will search for  host
                     names  in  the  current domain and in parent domains; see
                     [4mhostname[24m(7).  This is used by the  standard  host  lookup
                     routine  [4mgethostbyname[24m(3).  This option is enabled by de‚Äê
                     fault.

       The [1mres_init[22m() routine  reads  the  configuration  file  (if  any;  see
       [4mresolver[24m(5)) to get the default domain name, search list and the Inter‚Äê
       net  address  of the local name server(s).  If no server is configured,
       the host running the resolver is tried.  The current domain name is de‚Äê
       fined by the hostname if not specified in the  configuration  file;  it
       can be overridden by the environment variable LOCALDOMAIN.  Initializa‚Äê
       tion  normally  occurs  on  the first call to one of the following rou‚Äê
       tines.

       The [1mres_query[22m() function provides an  interface  to  the  server  query
       mechanism.  It constructs a query, sends it to the local server, awaits
       a  response,  and makes preliminary checks on the reply.  The query re‚Äê
       quests information of the specified [4mtype[24m and [4mclass[24m  for  the  specified
       fully‚Äêqualified  domain  name  [4mdname[24m.  The reply message is left in the
       [4manswer[24m buffer with length [4manslen[24m supplied by the caller.

       The [1mres_search[22m() routine makes a  query  and  awaits  a  response  like
       [1mres_query[22m(),  but  in  addition,  it  implements the default and search
       rules controlled by the RES_DEFNAMES and RES_DNSRCH  options.   It  re‚Äê
       turns the first successful reply.

       The  remaining  routines  are lower‚Äêlevel routines used by [1mres_query[22m().
       The [1mres_mkquery[22m() function constructs  a  standard  query  message  and
       places it in [4mbuf[24m.  It returns the size of the query, or -1 if the query
       is  larger than [4mbuflen[24m.  The query type [4mop[24m is usually QUERY, but can be
       any of the query types defined in ‚ü®[4marpa/nameser.h[24m‚ü©.   The  domain  name
       for  the query is given by [4mdname[24m.  [4mNewrr[24m is currently unused but is in‚Äê
       tended for making update messages.

       The [1mres_send[22m() routine sends a pre‚Äêformatted query and returns  an  an‚Äê
       swer.   It  will call [1mres_init[22m() if RES_INIT is not set, send the query
       to the local name server, and handle timeouts and retries.  The  length
       of the reply message is returned, or -1 if there were errors.

       The  [1mdn_comp[22m() function compresses the domain name [4mexp_dn[24m and stores it
       in [4mcomp_dn[24m.  The size of the compressed name is returned or -1 if there
       were errors.  The size of the array pointed to by [4mcomp_dn[24m is  given  by
       [4mlength[24m.   The  compression  uses  an array of pointers [4mdnptrs[24m to previ‚Äê
       ously‚Äêcompressed names in  the  current  message.   The  first  pointer
       points  to to the beginning of the message and the list ends with NULL.
       The limit to the array is specified by [4mlastdnptr[24m.   A  side  effect  of
       [1mdn_comp[22m()  is  to  update the list of pointers for labels inserted into
       the message as the name is compressed.  If [4mdnptr[24m is NULL, names are not
       compressed. If [4mlastdnptr[24m is NULL, the list of labels is not updated.

       The [1mdn_expand[22m() entry expands the compressed domain name [4mcomp_dn[24m  to  a
       full  domain  name The compressed name is contained in a query or reply
       message; [4mmsg[24m is a pointer to the beginning of the message.  The  uncom‚Äê
       pressed  name  is  placed in the buffer indicated by [4mexp_dn[24m which is of
       size [4mlength[24m.  The size of compressed name is returned or  -1  if  there
       was an error.
