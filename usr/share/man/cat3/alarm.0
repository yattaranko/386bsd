[1mNAME[0m
       alarm ‚Äî set signal timer alarm

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mu_int[0m
       [1malarm[22m([4mu_int[24m [4mseconds[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mThis interface is made obsolete by setitimer(2).[0m

       The [1malarm[22m() function waits a count of [4mseconds[24m before asserting the ter‚Äê
       minating signal SIGALRM.  When the signal has successfully been caught,
       [1malarm[22m() returns the amount of time left on the clock.  The maximum mum‚Äê
       ber of [4mseconds[24m allowed is 2147483647.

       If an alarm has been set with [1malarm[22m(), another call to [1malarm[22m() will su‚Äê
       perceed the prior call.  The request [1malarm[22m([4m0[24m) voids the current alarm.
