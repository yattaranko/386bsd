[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mradixsort[22m() function is a modified radix sort.

       The  [1mradixsort[22m()  function  sorts  an  array  of [4mnmemb[24m pointers to byte
       strings, the initial member of which is referenced by [4mbase[24m.   The  byte
       strings  may  contain  any values; the end of each string is denoted by
       the user‚Äêspecified value [4mendbyte[24m.  The contents of the array are sorted
       in ascending order according to the ASCII order  of  the  byte  strings
       they reference.

       Applications  may specify a sort order by providing the [4mtable[24m argument.
       If non‚ÄêNULL, [4mtable[24m must reference an array of UCHAR_MAX + 1 bytes which
       contains the sort weight of each  possible  byte  value.   The  end‚Äêof‚Äê
       string  byte must have a sort weight of 0.  More than one byte may have
       the same sort weight.  The [4mtable[24m argument is  useful  for  applications
       which wish to sort different characters equally; for example, providing
       a table with the same weights for A‚ÄêZ as for a‚Äêz will result in a case‚Äê
       insensitive sort.

       The [1mradixsort[22m() function is stable, that is, if two elements compare as
       equal, their order in the sorted array is unchanged.

       The  [1mradixsort[22m()  function  is a variant of most‚Äêsignificant‚Äêbyte radix
       sorting; in particular, see D.E. Knuth‚Äôs Algorithm R and section 5.2.5,
       exercise 10.  The [1mradixsort[22m() function takes linear  time  relative  to
       the number of bytes in the strings.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon  successful  completion  0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned
       and the global variable [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The [1mradixsort[22m() function may fail and set [4merrno[24m for any of  the  errors
       specified for the library routine [4mmalloc[24m(3).

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mradixsort[22m() function is currently under development.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The [4mnmemb[24m argument must be less than the maximum integer, INT_MAX.
