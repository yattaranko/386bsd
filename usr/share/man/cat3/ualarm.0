[1mNAME[0m
       ualarm ‚Äî schedule signal after specified time

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mu_int[0m
       [1mualarm[22m([4mu_int[24m [4mmicroseconds[24m, [4mu_int[24m [4minterval[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mThis is a simplified interface to setitimer(2).[0m

       The  [1mualarm[22m()  function  waits a count of [4mmicroseconds[24m before asserting
       the terminating signal SIGALRM.  System activity or time used  in  pro‚Äê
       cessing the call may cause a slight delay.

       If  the  [4minterval[24m argument is non‚Äêzero, the SIGALRM signal will be sent
       to the process every [4minterval[24m  microseconds  after  the  timer  expires
       (e.g. after [4mvalue[24m microseconds have passed).

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       When  the  signal  has  successfully  been  caught, [1malarm[22m() returns the
       amount of time left on the clock.  The maximum mumber  of  [4mmicroseconds[0m
       allowed is 2147483647.
