[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  function  [1mfread[22m()  reads  [4mnmemb[24m  elements of data, each [4msize[24m bytes
       long, from the stream pointed to by [4mstream[24m, storing them at  the  loca‚Äê
       tion given by [4mptr[24m.

       The  function  [1mfwrite[22m()  writes [4mnmemb[24m elements of data, each [4msize[24m bytes
       long, to the stream pointed to by [4mstream[24m, obtaining them from the loca‚Äê
       tion given by [4mptr[24m.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The functions [1mfread[22m() and [1mfwrite[22m() advance the file position  indicator
       for the stream by the number of characters successfully read or written
       and  return  that  number.   If  an error occurs, or the end‚Äêof‚Äêfile is
       reached, the return value is a short character count (or zero).

       The function [1mfread[22m() does not distinguish between end‚Äêof‚Äêfile  and  er‚Äê
       ror,  and callers must use [4mfeof[24m(3) and [4mferror[24m(3) to determine which oc‚Äê
       curred.
