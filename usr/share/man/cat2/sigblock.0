[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mThis interface is made obsolete by: [4m[22msigprocmask[24m(2).

       [1mSigblock[22m()  adds  the  signals  specified in [4mmask[24m to the set of signals
       currently being blocked from delivery.  Signals are blocked if the cor‚Äê
       responding bit in [4mmask[24m is a 1; the macro [1msigmask[22m() is provided to  con‚Äê
       struct the mask for a given [4msignum[24m.

       It  is  not  possible  to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP; this restriction is
       silently imposed by the system.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The previous set of masked signals is returned.
