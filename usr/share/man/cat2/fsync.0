[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mFsync[22m()  causes all modified data and attributes of [4mfd[24m to be moved to a
       permanent storage device.  This normally results in all  in‚Äêcore  modi‚Äê
       fied copies of buffers for the associated file to be written to a disk.

       [1mFsync[22m() should be used by programs that require a file to be in a known
       state, for example, in building a simple transaction facility.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       A 0 value is returned on success.  A ‚Äê1 value indicates an error.
