[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mGetfsstat[22m()  returns information about all mounted filesystems.  [4mBuf[24m is
       a pointer to [4mstatfs[24m structures defined as follows:

       typedef quad fsid_t;

       #define MNAMELEN 32     /* length of buffer for returned name */

       struct statfs {
           short   f_type;     /* type of filesystem (see below) */
           short   f_flags;    /* copy of mount flags */
           long    f_fsize;    /* fundamental filesystem block size */
           long    f_bsize;    /* optimal transfer block size */
           long    f_blocks;   /* total data blocks in filesystem */
           long    f_bfree;    /* free blocks in fs */
           long    f_bavail;   /* free blocks avail to non‚Äêsuperuser */
           long    f_files;    /* total file nodes in filesystem */
           long    f_ffree;    /* free file nodes in fs */
           fsid_t  f_fsid;     /* filesystem id */
           long    f_spare[6]; /* spare for later */
           char    f_mntonname[MNAMELEN]; /* directory on which mounted */
           char    f_mntfromname[MNAMELEN]; /* mounted filesystem */
       };
       /*
        * File system types.
        */
       #define MOUNT_UFS       1
       #define MOUNT_NFS       2
       #define MOUNT_PC        3

       Fields that are undefined for a particular filesystem are  set  to  ‚Äê1.
       The  buffer  is filled with an array of [4mfsstat[24m structures, one for each
       mounted filesystem up to the size specified by [4mbufsize[24m.

       If [4mbuf[24m is given as NULL, [1mgetfsstat[22m() returns just the number of mounted
       filesystems.

       Normally [4mflags[24m should be specified as MNT_WAIT.  If  [4mflags[24m  is  set  to
       MNT_NOWAIT,  [1mgetfsstat[22m()  will  return the information it has available
       without requesting an update from each filesystem.  Thus, some  of  the
       information will be out of date, but [1mgetfsstat[22m() will not block waiting
       for information from a filesystem that is unable to respond.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon  successful  completion,  the  number  of [4mfsstat[24m structures is re‚Äê
       turned.  Otherwise, ‚Äê1 is returned and the global variable [4merrno[24m is set
       to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mGetfsstat[22m() fails if one or more of the following are true:

       EFAULT             [4mBuf[24m points to an invalid address.

       EIO                An I/O error occurred while reading from or  writing
                          to the filesystem.

       The [1mgetfsstat [22mfunction call is currently under development.
