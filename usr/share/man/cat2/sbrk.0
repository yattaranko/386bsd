[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mThe  brk  and  sbrk functions are historical curiosities left over from[0m
       [1mearlier days before the advent of virtual memory management.  [22mThe [1mbrk[22m()
       function sets the break or lowest address of a process‚Äôs  data  segment
       (unilitialized  data) to [4maddr[24m (immediately above bss).  Data addressing
       is restricted between [4maddr[24m and the lowest stack pointer  to  the  stack
       segment.   Memory  is  allocated by [4mbrk[24m in page size pieces; if [4maddr[24m is
       not evenly divisible by the system page size, it is  increased  to  the
       next page boundary.

       The  current  value  of  the  program  break  is  reliably  returned by
       ‚Äú[1msbrk(0)[22m‚Äù (see also [4mend[24m(3)).  The [4mgetrlimit[24m(2) system call may be  used
       to  determine the maximum permissible size of the [4mdata[24m segment; it will
       not be possible to set the break beyond  the  [4mrlim_max[24m  value  returned
       from  a  call  to [4mgetrlimit[24m, e.g.  ‚Äúqetext + rlp‚Üírlim_max.‚Äù (see [4mend[24m(3)
       for the definition of [4metext[24m).

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       [1mBrk [22mreturns 0 if successful; ‚Äê1 if the  process  requests  more  memory
       than  than allowed by the system limit.  The [1msbrk [22mfunction returns 0 if
       successful, otherwise the error EOPNOTSUPP is returned.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m

[1mBUGS[0m
       Setting the break may fail due to a temporary lack of swap  space.   It
       is  not possible to distinguish this from a failure caused by exceeding
       the maximum size of the data segment without consulting [4mgetrlimit[24m.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       A [1mbrk [22mfunction call appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
