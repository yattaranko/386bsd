GETPGRP(2)                    System Calls Manual                   GETPGRP(2)

[1mNAME[0m
       getpgrp â€” get process group

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [4mpid_t[0m
       [1mgetpgrp[22m([4mint[24m [4mpid[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  process  group  of the specified process is returned by [1mgetpgrp[22m().
       If [4mpid[24m is zero, the call applies to the current process.

       Process groups are used for distribution of signals, and  by  terminals
       to  arbitrate  requests  for  their input: processes that have the same
       process group as the terminal are foreground and may read, while others
       will block with a signal if they attempt to read.

       This call is thus used by programs such as  [4mcsh[24m(1)  to  create  process
       groups  in implementing job control.  The TIOCGPGRP and TIOCSPGRP calls
       described in [4mtermios[24m(4) are used to get/set the process  group  of  the
       control terminal.
