       kill ‚Äî send signal to a process

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <sys/signal.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1mkill[22m([4mpid_t[24m [4mpid[24m, [4mint[24m [4msig[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mkill[22m() function sends the signal given by [4msig[24m to [4mpid[24m, a process or
       a group of processes.  [4mSig[24m may be  one  of  the  signals  specified  in
       [4msigaction[24m(2)  or it may be 0, in which case error checking is performed
       but no signal is actually sent.  This can be used to check the validity
       of [4mpid[24m.

       For a process to have permission to send a signal to a  process  desig‚Äê
       nated  by  [4mpid[24m,  the  real or effective user ID of the receving process
       must match that of the sending process or the user must have  appropri‚Äê
       ate  privileges  (such as given by a set‚Äêuser‚ÄêID program or the user is
       the super‚Äêuser).  A single exception is the signal SIGCONT,  which  may
       always be sent to any descendant of the current process.

       If [4mpid[24m is greater than zero:
               [4mSig[24m is sent to the process whose ID is equal to [4mpid.[0m

       If [4mpid[24m is zero:
               [4mSig[24m  is  sent  to  all processes whose group ID is equal to the
               process group ID of the sender, and for which the  process  has
               permission; this is a variant of [4mkillpg[24m(2).

       If [4mpid[24m is ‚Äê1:
               If  the  user  has super user privileges, the signal is sent to
               all processes excluding system processes. If the  user  is  not
               the  super  user,  the signal is sent to all processes with the
               same uid as the user except the process sending the signal.  No
               error is returned if any process could be signaled.

       For compatibility with System V, if the process number is negative  but
       not  ‚Äê1,  the signal is sent to all processes whose process group ID is
       equal to the absolute value of the process number.  This is  a  variant
       of [4mkillpg[24m(2).

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon  successful  completion,  a  value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mKill[22m() will fail and no signal will be sent if:

       [EINVAL]  [4mSig[24m is not a valid signal number.

       [ESRCH]   No process can be found corresponding to  that  specified  by
                 [4mpid[24m.

       [ESRCH]   The  process  id  was given as 0 but the sending process does
                 not have a process group.

       [EPERM]   The sending process is not the super‚Äêuser and  its  effective
                 user id does not match the effective user‚Äêid of the receiving
                 process.   When  signaling a process group, this error is re‚Äê
                 turned if any members of the group could not be signaled.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The [1mkill[22m() function is expected to  conform  to  IEEE  Std  1003.1‚Äê1988
       (‚ÄúPOSIX‚Äù).
