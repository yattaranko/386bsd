[1mNAME[0m
       symlink ‚Äî make symbolic link to a file

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1msymlink[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*name1[24m, [4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*name2[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       A  symbolic  link  [4mname2[24m  is created to [4mname1[24m ([4mname2[24m is the name of the
       file created, [4mname1[24m is the string used in creating the symbolic  link).
       Either name may be an arbitrary path name; the files need not be on the
       same file system.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon  successful completion, a zero value is returned.  If an error oc‚Äê
       curs, the error code is stored in [4merrno[24m and a ‚Äê1 value is returned.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The symbolic link succeeds unless:

       [ENOTDIR]
                 A component of the [4mname2[24m prefix is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]  Either [4mname1[24m or [4mname2[24m contains a character with the  high‚Äêor‚Äê
                 der bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
                 A  component  of  either pathname exceeded 255 characters, or
                 the entire length of either path name exceeded  1023  charac‚Äê
                 ters.

       [ENOENT]  The named file does not exist.

       [EACCES]  A  component  of  the [4mname2[24m path prefix denies search permis‚Äê
                 sion.

       [ELOOP]   Too many symbolic links were encountered in  translating  the
                 pathname.

       [EEXIST]  [4mName2[24m already exists.

       [EIO]     An  I/O  error  occurred while making the directory entry for
                 [4mname2[24m, or allocating the inode for [4mname2[24m, or writing out  the
                 link contents of [4mname2[24m.

       [EROFS]   The file [4mname2[24m would reside on a read‚Äêonly file system.

       [ENOSPC]  The directory in which the entry for the new symbolic link is
                 being  placed  cannot  be  extended because there is no space
                 left on the file system containing the directory.

       [ENOSPC]  The new symbolic link cannot be created because  there  there
                 is  no  space  left  on the file system that will contain the
                 symbolic link.

       [ENOSPC]  There are no free inodes on the file system on which the sym‚Äê
                 bolic link is being created.

       [EDQUOT]  The directory in which the entry for the new symbolic link is
                 being placed cannot be extended because the user‚Äôs  quota  of
                 disk  blocks  on the file system containing the directory has
                 been exhausted.

       [EDQUOT]  The new symbolic link cannot be created  because  the  user‚Äôs
                 quota of disk blocks on the file system that will contain the
                 symbolic link has been exhausted.

       [EDQUOT]  The  user‚Äôs  quota  of inodes on the file system on which the
                 symbolic link is being created has been exhausted.

       [EIO]     An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry or al‚Äê
                 locating the inode.

       [EFAULT]  [4mName1[24m or [4mname2[24m points outside the process‚Äôs allocated address
                 space.
