LINK(2)                       System Calls Manual                      LINK(2)

[1mNAME[0m
       link ‚Äî make a hard file link

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1mlink[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*name1[24m, [4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*name2[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mlink[22m() function call atomically creates the specified directory en‚Äê
       try  (hard  link)  [4mname2[24m  with  the attributes of the underlying object
       pointed at by [4mname1[24m If the link is successful: the link  count  of  the
       underlying  object  is  incremented; [4mname1[24m and [4mname2[24m share equal access
       and rights to the underlying object.

       If [4mname1[24m is removed, the file [4mname2[24m is not deleted and the  link  count
       of the underlying object is decremented.

       [4mName1[24m  must exist for the hard link to succeed and both [4mname1[24m and [4mname2[0m
       must be in the same file system.  Unless the caller is the  super‚Äêuser,
       [4mname1[24m may not be a directory.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon  successful  completion,  a  value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mLink[22m() will fail and no link will be created if: are true:

       [ENOTDIR]     A component of either path prefix is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]      Either pathname contains a character with the  high‚Äêorder
                     bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
                     A  component  of either pathname exceeded 255 characters,
                     or entire length of either path name exceeded 1023  char‚Äê
                     acters.

       [ENOENT]      A component of either path prefix does not exist.

       [EACCES]      A  component  of either path prefix denies search permis‚Äê
                     sion.

       [EACCES]      The requested link requires writing in a directory with a
                     mode that denies write permission.

       [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered  in  translating
                     one of the pathnames.

       [ENOENT]      The file named by [4mname1[24m does not exist.

       [EEXIST]      The link named by [4mname2[24m does exist.

       [EPERM]       The  file named by [4mname1[24m is a directory and the effective
                     user ID is not super‚Äêuser.

       [EXDEV]       The link named by [4mname2[24m and the file named by  [4mname1[24m  are
                     on different file systems.

       [ENOSPC]      The  directory in which the entry for the new link is be‚Äê
                     ing placed cannot be extended because there is  no  space
                     left on the file system containing the directory.

       [EDQUOT]      The  directory in which the entry for the new link is be‚Äê
                     ing placed cannot be extended because the user‚Äôs quota of
                     disk blocks on the file system containing  the  directory
                     has been exhausted.

       [EIO]         An  I/O  error  occurred while reading from or writing to
                     the file system to make the directory entry.

       [EROFS]       The requested link requires writing in a directory  on  a
                     read‚Äêonly file system.

       [EFAULT]      One  of  the pathnames specified is outside the process‚Äôs
                     allocated address space.
