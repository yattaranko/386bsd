[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mMkdir[22m() will fail and no directory will be created if:

       [ENOTDIR]   A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]    The pathname contains a character with the  high‚Äêorder  bit
                   set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A  component  of  a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]    A component of the path prefix does not exist.

       [EACCES]    Search permission is denied for a  component  of  the  path
                   prefix.

       [ELOOP]     Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

       [EPERM]     The  [4mpath[24m  argument contains a byte with the high‚Äêorder bit
                   set.

       [EROFS]     The named file resides on a read‚Äêonly file system.

       [EEXIST]    The named file exists.

       [ENOSPC]    The directory in which the entry for the new  directory  is
                   being  placed  cannot be extended because there is no space
                   left on the file system containing the directory.

       [ENOSPC]    The new directory cannot be created because there there  is
                   no  space left on the file system that will contain the di‚Äê
                   rectory.

       [ENOSPC]    There are no free inodes on the file system  on  which  the
                   directory is being created.

       [EDQUOT]    The  directory  in which the entry for the new directory is
                   being placed cannot be extended because the user‚Äôs quota of
                   disk blocks on the file system containing the directory has
                   been exhausted.

       [EDQUOT]    The new directory cannot  be  created  because  the  user‚Äôs
                   quota  of  disk blocks on the file system that will contain
                   the directory has been exhausted.

       [EDQUOT]    The user‚Äôs quota of inodes on the file system on which  the
                   directory is being created has been exhausted.

       [EIO]       An  I/O  error occurred while making the directory entry or
                   allocating the inode.

       [EIO]       An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to  the
                   file system.
