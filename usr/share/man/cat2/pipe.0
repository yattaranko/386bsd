PIPE(2)                       System Calls Manual                      PIPE(2)

[1mNAME[0m
       pipe ‚Äî create descriptor pair for interprocess communication

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1mpipe[22m([4mint[24m [4m*fildes[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mpipe[22m() function creates a [4mpipe[24m, which is an object allowing unidi‚Äê
       rectional data flow, and allocates a pair  of  file  descriptors.   The
       first  descriptor  connects to the [4mread[24m [4mend[24m of the pipe, and the second
       connects to the [4mwrite[24m [4mend[24m, so that data written to [4mfildes[1][24m appears on
       (i.e., can be read from) [4mfildes[0][24m.  This allows the output of one pro‚Äê
       gram to be sent to another program: the source‚Äôs standard output is set
       up to be the write end of the pipe, and the sink‚Äôs  standard  input  is
       set  up to be the read end of the pipe.  The pipe itself persists until
       all its associated descriptors are closed.

       A pipe whose read or write end has been closed is  considered  [4mwidowed[24m.
       Writing  on such a pipe causes the writing process to receive a SIGPIPE
       signal.  Widowing a pipe is the only way to deliver  end‚Äêof‚Äêfile  to  a
       reader:  after the reader consumes any buffered data, reading a widowed
       pipe returns a zero count.

       Pipes are really a special case of the [4msocketpair[24m(2) call and, in fact,
       are implemented as such in the system.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       On successful creation of the pipe,  zero  is  returned.  Otherwise,  a
       value  of ‚Äê1 is returned and the variable [4merrno[24m set to indicate the er‚Äê
       ror.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The [1mpipe[22m() call will fail if:

       [EMFILE]  Too many descriptors are active.

       [ENFILE]  The system file table is full.

       [EFAULT]  The [4mfildes[24m buffer is in an invalid area of the process‚Äôs  ad‚Äê
                 dress space.
