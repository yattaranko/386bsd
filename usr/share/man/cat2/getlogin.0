[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mgetlogin[22m()  routine  returns the login name of the user associated
       with the current session, as previously set by [1msetlogin[22m().  The name is
       normally associated with a login shell at the time a  session  is  cre‚Äê
       ated, and is inherited by all processes descended from the login shell.
       (This  is  true even if some of those processes assume another user ID,
       for example when [4msu[24m(1) is used.)

       [1mSetlogin[22m() sets the login name of the user associated with the  current
       session  to  [4mname[24m.   This  call is restricted to the super‚Äêuser, and is
       normally used only when a new session is being created on behalf of the
       named user (for example, at login time, or when a remote shell  is  in‚Äê
       voked).

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       If a call to [1mgetlogin[22m() succeeds, it returns a pointer to a null‚Äêtermi‚Äê
       nated  string in a static buffer.  If the name has not been set, it re‚Äê
       turns NULL.  If a call to [1msetlogin[22m() succeeds, a  value  of  0  is  re‚Äê
       turned.   If  [1msetlogin[22m()  fails, a value of ‚Äê1 is returned and an error
       code is placed in the global location [4merrno[24m.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The following errors may be returned by these calls:

       [EFAULT]           The [4mname[24m parameter gave an invalid address.

       [EINVAL]           The [4mname[24m parameter pointed to a string that was  too
                          long.   Login  names are limited to MAXLOGNAME (from
                          ‚ü®[4msys/param.h[24m‚ü©) characters, currently 12.

       [EPERM]            The caller tried to set the login name and  was  not
                          the super‚Äêuser.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4msetsid[24m(2)

[1mBUGS[0m
       Login names are limited in length by [1msetlogin[22m().  However, lower limits
       are  placed  on  login  names  elsewhere  in the system (UT_NAMESIZE in
       ‚ü®[4mutmp.h[24m‚ü©).

       In earlier versions of the system, [1mgetlogin[22m() failed unless the process
       was associated with a login terminal.  The current implementation  (us‚Äê
       ing [1msetlogin[22m()) allows getlogin to succeed even when the process has no
       controlling terminal.  In earlier versions of the system, the value re‚Äê
       turned by [1mgetlogin[22m() could not be trusted without checking the user ID.
       Portable programs should probably still make this check.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mgetlogin [22mfunction call is currently under development.
