       [4mint[0m
       [1mdup2[22m([4mint[24m [4moldd[24m, [4mint[24m [4mnewd[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mDup[22m() duplicates an existing object descriptor and returns its value to
       the  calling  process ([4mnewd[24m = [1mdup[22m([4moldd[24m)).  The argument [4moldd[24m is a small
       non‚Äênegative integer index in the per‚Äêprocess  descriptor  table.   The
       value  must  be  less  than the size of the table, which is returned by
       [4mgetdtablesize[24m(2).  The new descriptor returned by the call is the  low‚Äê
       est numbered descriptor currently not in use by the process.

       The  object  referenced  by the descriptor does not distinguish between
       [4moldd[24m and [4mnewd[24m in any way.  Thus if [4mnewd[24m and [4moldd[24m are  duplicate  refer‚Äê
       ences  to an open file, [4mread[24m(2), [4mwrite[24m(2) and [4mlseek[24m(2) calls all move a
       single pointer into the file, and append  mode,  non‚Äêblocking  I/O  and
       asynchronous I/O options are shared between the references.  If a sepa‚Äê
       rate  pointer into the file is desired, a different object reference to
       the file must be obtained by issuing an additional [4mopen[24m(2)  call.   The
       close‚Äêon‚Äêexec flag on the new file descriptor is unset.

       In  [1mdup2[22m(), the value of the new descriptor [4mnewd[24m is specified.  If this
       descriptor is already in use, the descriptor is first deallocated as if
       a [4mclose[24m(2) call had been done first.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The value ‚Äê1 is returned if an error occurs in either call.  The exter‚Äê
       nal variable [4merrno[24m indicates the cause of the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mDup[22m() and [1mdup2[22m() fail if:

       [EBADF]            [4mOldd[24m or [4mnewd[24m is not a valid active descriptor

       [EMFILE]           Too many descriptors are active.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       [1mDup[22m()  and  [1mdup2[22m()  are  expected  to  conform  to IEEE Std 1003.1‚Äê1988
       (‚ÄúPOSIX‚Äù).
