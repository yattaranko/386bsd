[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mGetgroups[22m()  gets the current group access list of the user process and
       stores it in the array [4mgidset[24m.  The parameter [4mgidsetlen[24m  indicates  the
       number  of  entries  that may be placed in [4mgidset[24m.  [1mGetgroups[22m() returns
       the actual number of groups returned in [4mgidset[24m.  No more than  NGROUPS,
       as defined in ‚ü®[4msys/param.h[24m‚ü©, will ever be returned.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       A  successful  call  returns  the number of groups in the group set.  A
       value of ‚Äê1 indicates that an error occurred, and  the  error  code  is
       stored in the global variable [4merrno[24m.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The possible errors for [1mgetgroups[22m() are:

       [EINVAL]           The argument [4mgidsetlen[24m is smaller than the number of
                          groups in the group set.

       [EFAULT]           The argument [4mgidset[24m specifies an invalid address.

[1mBUGS[0m
       The  [4mgidset[24m array should be of type [4mgid_t[24m, but remains integer for com‚Äê
       patibility with earlier systems.
