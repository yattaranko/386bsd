       [1mmknod[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*path[24m, [4mmode_t[24m [4mmode[24m, [4mdev_t[24m [4mdev[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The device special file [4mpath[24m is created with the major and minor device
       numbers extracted from [4mmode.[24m The access permissions of [4mpath[24m are descen‚Äê
       dant from the [4mumask[24m(2) of the parent process.

       If  [4mmode[24m indicates a block or character special file, [4mdev[24m is a configu‚Äê
       ration dependent specification of a character or block I/O  device  and
       the  superblock  of the device.  If [4mmode[24m does not indicate a block spe‚Äê
       cial or character special device, [4mdev[24m is ignored.

       [1mMknod[22m() requires super‚Äêuser privileges.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion a value of  0  is  returned.   Otherwise,  a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mMknod[22m() will fail and the file will be not created if:

       [EINVAL]           The  pathname contains a character with the high‚Äêor‚Äê

       [EPERM]            The process‚Äôs effective user ID is not super‚Äêuser.

       [EPERM]            The  pathname contains a character with the high‚Äêor‚Äê

       [ENOSPC]           The directory in which the entry for the new node is
                          being placed cannot be extended because there is  no
                          space  left on the file system containing the direc‚Äê
                          tory.

       [ENOSPC]           There are no free inodes on the file system on which
                          the node is being created.

       [EDQUOT]           The directory in which the entry for the new node is
                          being placed cannot be extended because  the  user‚Äôs
