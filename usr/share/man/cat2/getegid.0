[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mgetgid[22m() function returns the real group ID of the calling process,
       [1mgetegid[22m() returns the effective group ID of the calling process.

       The real group ID is specified at login time.

       The real group ID is the group of the user who invoked the program.  As
       the  effective group ID gives the process additional permissions during
       the execution of ‚Äú[4mset‚Äêgroup‚ÄêID[24m‚Äù mode processes, [1mgetgid[22m() is used to de‚Äê
       termine the real‚Äêuser‚Äêid of the calling process.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The [1mgetgid[22m() and [1mgetegid[22m() functions are always successful, and no  re‚Äê
       turn value is reserved to indicate an error.
