[1mNAME[0m
       unlink ‚Äî remove directory entry

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1munlink[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*path[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1munlink[22m() function removes the link named by [4mpath[24m from its directory
       and  decrements  the link count of the file which was referenced by the
       link.  If that decrement reduces the link count of the  file  to  zero,
       and  no  process  has the file open, then all resources associated with
       the file are reclaimed.  If one or more process have the file open when
       the last link is removed, the link is removed, but the removal  of  the
       file is delayed until all references to it have been closed.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon  successful  completion,  a  value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The [1munlink[22m() succeeds unless:

       [ENOTDIR]       A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]        The pathname contains a character with  the  high‚Äêorder
                       bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]  A  component  of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or
                       an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]        The named file does not exist.

       [EACCES]        Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                       prefix.

       [EACCES]        Write permission is denied on the directory  containing
                       the link to be removed.

       [ELOOP]         Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
                       the pathname.

       [EPERM]         The named file is a directory and the effective user ID
                       of the process is not the super‚Äêuser.

       [EPERM]         The directory containing the file is marked sticky, and
                       neither the containing directory nor the file to be re‚Äê
                       moved are owned by the effective user ID.

       [EBUSY]         The  entry  to  be  unlinked  is  the mount point for a
                       mounted file system.

       [EIO]           An I/O error occurred while deleting the directory  en‚Äê
                       try or deallocating the inode.

       [EROFS]         The named file resides on a read‚Äêonly file system.

       [EFAULT]        [4mPath[24m  points  outside  the  process‚Äôs allocated address
                       space.
