[1mNAME[0m
       rename ‚Äî change the name of a file

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <stdio.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1mrename[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*from[24m, [4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*to[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mRename[22m() causes the link named [4mfrom[24m to be renamed as [4mto[24m.  If [4mto[24m exists,
       it  is  first removed.  Both [4mfrom[24m and [4mto[24m must be of the same type (that
       is, both directories or both non‚Äêdirectories), and must reside  on  the
       same file system.

       [1mRename[22m()  guarantees  that an instance of [4mto[24m will always exist, even if
       the system should crash in the middle of the operation.

       If the final component of [4mfrom[24m is a symbolic link, the symbolic link is
       renamed, not the file or directory to which it points.

[1mCAVEAT[0m
       The system can deadlock if a loop in the file system graph is  present.
       This loop takes the form of an entry in directory ‚Äò[4ma[24m‚Äô, say ‚Äò[4ma/foo[24m‚Äô, be‚Äê
       ing  a  hard  link to directory ‚Äò[4mb[24m‚Äô, and an entry in directory ‚Äò[4mb[24m‚Äô, say
       ‚Äò[4mb/bar[24m‚Äô, being a hard link to directory ‚Äò[4ma[24m‚Äô.  When such a  loop  exists
       and  two separate processes attempt to perform ‚Äòrename a/foo b/bar‚Äô and
       ‚Äòrename b/bar a/foo‚Äô, respectively, the system may deadlock  attempting
       to  lock  both directories for modification.  Hard links to directories
       should be replaced by symbolic links by the system administrator.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       A 0 value is returned if the operation succeeds, otherwise [1mrename[22m() re‚Äê
       turns ‚Äê1 and the global variable [4merrno[24m indicates  the  reason  for  the
       failure.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mRename[22m()  will  fail and neither of the argument files will be affected
       if:

       [EINVAL]      Either pathname contains a character with the  high‚Äêorder
                     bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
                     A  component  of either pathname exceeded 255 characters,
                     or the entire length of either path  name  exceeded  1023
                     characters.

       [ENOENT]      A  component  of  the [4mfrom[24m path does not exist, or a path
                     prefix of [4mto[24m does not exist.

       [EACCES]      A component of either path prefix denies  search  permis‚Äê
                     sion.

       [EACCES]      The requested link requires writing in a directory with a
                     mode that denies write permission.

       [EPERM]       The  directory containing [4mfrom[24m is marked sticky, and nei‚Äê
                     ther the containing directory nor [4mfrom[24m are owned  by  the
                     effective user ID.

       [EPERM]       The [4mto[24m file exists, the directory containing [4mto[24m is marked
                     sticky,  and  neither the containing directory nor [4mto[24m are
                     owned by the effective user ID.

       [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered  in  translating
                     either pathname.

       [ENOTDIR]     A component of either path prefix is not a directory.

       [ENOTDIR]     [4mfrom[24m is a directory, but [4mto[24m is not a directory.

       [EISDIR]      [4mto[24m is a directory, but [4mfrom[24m is not a directory.

       [EXDEV]       The  link  named  by [4mto[24m and the file named by [4mfrom[24m are on
                     different logical devices (file systems).  Note that this
                     error code will not be  returned  if  the  implementation
                     permits cross‚Äêdevice links.

       [ENOSPC]      The  directory in which the entry for the new name is be‚Äê
                     ing placed cannot be extended because there is  no  space
                     left on the file system containing the directory.

       [EDQUOT]      The  directory in which the entry for the new name is be‚Äê
                     ing placed cannot be extended because the user‚Äôs quota of
                     disk blocks on the file system containing  the  directory
                     has been exhausted.

       [EIO]         An  I/O  error occurred while making or updating a direc‚Äê
                     tory entry.

       [EROFS]       The requested link requires writing in a directory  on  a
                     read‚Äêonly file system.

       [EFAULT]      [4mPath[24m  points  outside  the  process‚Äôs  allocated  address
                     space.

       [EINVAL]      [4mFrom[24m is a parent directory of [4mto[24m, or an attempt  is  made
                     to rename ‚Äò.‚Äô or ‚Äò..‚Äô.

       [ENOTEMPTY]   [4mTo[24m is a directory and is not empty.
