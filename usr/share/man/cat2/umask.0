       umask ‚Äî set file creation mode mask

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <sys/stat.h>[0m

       [4mmode_t[0m
       [1mumask[22m([4mmode_t[24m [4mnumask[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mumask[22m()  routine  sets  the  process‚Äôs  file mode creation mask to
       [4mnumask[24m and returns the previous value of the mask.  The 9 low‚Äêorder ac‚Äê
       cess permission bits of [4mnumask[24m are  used  by  system  calls,  including
       [4mopen[24m(2),  [4mmkdir[24m(2),  and  [4mmkfifo[24m(2), to turn off corresponding bits re‚Äê
       quested in file mode.  (see [4mchmod[24m(2)).  This clearing allows each  user
       to restrict the default access to his files.

       The  default  mask  value  is 022 (write access for owner only).  Child
       processes inherit the mask of the calling process.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The previous value of the file mode mask is returned by the call.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The [1mumask[22m() function is always successful.

       [4mchmod[24m(2), [4mmknod[24m(2), [4mopen[24m(2)

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The  [1mumask[22m()  function  call  is  expected  to  conform  to  IEEE   Std
       1003.1‚Äê1988 (‚ÄúPOSIX‚Äù).
