[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mSend[22m(), [1msendto[22m(), and [1msendmsg[22m() are used to transmit a message  to  an‚Äê
       other  socket.   [1mSend[22m()  may  be  used  only  when  the  socket is in a
       [4mconnected[24m state, while [1msendto[22m() and [1msendmsg[22m() may be used at any time.

       The address of the target is given by  [4mto[24m  with  [4mtolen[24m  specifying  its
       size.   The  length  of the message is given by [4mlen[24m.  If the message is
       too long to pass atomically through the underlying protocol, the  error
       EMSGSIZE is returned, and the message is not transmitted.

       No  indication  of failure to deliver is implicit in a [1msend[22m().  Locally
       detected errors are indicated by a return value of ‚Äê1.

       If no messages space is available at the socket to hold the message  to
       be transmitted, then [1msend[22m() normally blocks, unless the socket has been
       placed in non‚Äêblocking I/O mode.  The [4mselect[24m(2) call may be used to de‚Äê
       termine when it is possible to send more data.

       The [4mflags[24m parameter may include one or more of the following:

       #define MSG_OOB        0x1  /* process out‚Äêof‚Äêband data */
       #define MSG_DONTROUTE  0x4  /* bypass routing, use direct interface */

       The  flag  MSG_OOB  is  used to send ‚Äúout‚Äêof‚Äêband‚Äù data on sockets that
       support this notion (e.g.  SOCK_STREAM); the underlying  protocol  must
       also support ‚Äúout‚Äêof‚Äêband‚Äù data.  MSG_DONTROUTE is usually used only by
       diagnostic or routing programs.

       See [4mrecv[24m(2) for a description of the [4mmsghdr[24m structure.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       The  call  returns the number of characters sent, or ‚Äê1 if an error oc‚Äê
       curred.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mSend[22m(), [1msendto[22m(), and [1msendmsg[22m() fail if:

       [EBADF]        An invalid descriptor was specified.

       [ENOTSOCK]     The argument [4ms[24m is not a socket.

       [EFAULT]       An invalid user space address was specified for a  para‚Äê
                      meter.

       [EMSGSIZE]     The socket requires that message be sent atomically, and
                      the size of the message to be sent made this impossible.

       [EWOULDBLOCK]  The  socket is marked non‚Äêblocking and the requested op‚Äê
                      eration would block.

       [ENOBUFS]      The system was unable to allocate  an  internal  buffer.
                      The operation may succeed when buffers become available.

       [ENOBUFS]      The output queue for a network interface was full.  This
                      generally indicates that the interface has stopped send‚Äê
                      ing, but may be caused by transient congestion.
