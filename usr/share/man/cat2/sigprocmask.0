       [4mint[0m
       [1msigprocmask[22m([4mint[24m [4mhow[24m, [4mconst[24m [4msigset_t[24m [4m*set[24m, [4msigset_t[24m [4m*oset[24m);

       [1msigmask[22m([4msignum[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1msigprocmask[22m()  function examines and/or changes the current signal
       mask (those signals that  are  blocked  from  delivery).   Signals  are
       blocked if they are members of the current signal mask set.

       If [4mset[24m is not null, the action of [1msigprocmask[22m() depends on the value of
       the  parameter  [4mhow[24m.   The  signal mask is changed as a function of the
       specified [4mset[24m and the current mask.  The function is specified  by  [4mhow[0m
       using one of the following values from ‚ü®[4msignal.h[24m‚ü©:

       SIG_BLOCK    The  new  mask  is  the  union of the current mask and the
                    specified [4mset[24m.

       SIG_UNBLOCK  The new mask is the intersection of the current  mask  and
                    the complement of the specified [4mset[24m.

       SIG_SETMASK  The current mask is replaced by the specified [4mset[24m.

       If  [4moset[24m  is  not  null,  it is set to the previous value of the signal
       mask.  When [4mset[24m is null, the value of [4mhow[24m is insignificant and the mask
       remains unset providing a way to examine the signal mask without  modi‚Äê
       fication.

       The system quietly disallows SIGKILL or SIGSTOP to be blocked.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       A  0  value indicated that the call succeeded.  A ‚Äê1 return value indi‚Äê
       cates an error occurred and [4merrno[24m is set to indicated the reason.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The [1msigprocmask[22m() call will fail and the signal mask will be  unchanged
       if one of the following occurs:

       [EINVAL]      [4mhow[24m has a value other than those listed here.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The  [1msigprocmask  [22mfunction  call  is  expected  to  conform to IEEE Std
       1003.1‚Äê1988 (‚ÄúPOSIX.1‚Äù).
