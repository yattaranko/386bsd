[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mSigreturn[22m()  allows  users to atomically unmask, switch stacks, and re‚Äê
       turn from a signal context.  The processes signal mask and stack status
       are restored from the context.  The system call does  not  return;  the
       users  stack  pointer,  frame  pointer, argument pointer, and processor
       status longword are restored from the context.   Execution  resumes  at
       the  specified pc.  This system call is used by the trampoline code and
       [4mlongjmp[24m(3) when returning from a signal  to  the  previously  executing
       program.

[1mNOTES[0m
       This  system  call  is  not available in 4.2 BSD hence it should not be
       used if backward compatibility is needed.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       If successful, the system call does not return.  Otherwise, a value  of
       ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mSigreturn[22m()  will fail and the process context will remain unchanged if
       one of the following occurs.

       [EFAULT]  [4mScp[24m points to memory that is not a valid part of the  process
                 address space.

       [EINVAL]  The  process  status  longword is invalid or would improperly
                 raise the privilege level of the process.
