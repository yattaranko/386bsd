       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1msetpgid[22m([4mpid_tpid[24m, [4mpid_tpgrp[24m);

       [4mint[0m
       [1msetpgrp[22m([4mpid_tpid[24m, [4mpid_tpgrp[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mSetpgid[22m()  sets  the  process group of the specified process [4mpid[24m to the
       specified [4mpgrp[24m.  If [4mpid[24m is zero, then the call applies to  the  current
       process.

       If  the  invoker  is not the super‚Äêuser, then the affected process must
       have the same effective user‚Äêid as the invoker or be  a  descendant  of
       the invoking process.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       [1mSetpgid[22m()  returns 0 when the operation was successful.  If the request
       failed, ‚Äê1 is returned and the global variable [4merrno[24m indicates the rea‚Äê
       son.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mSetpgid[22m() will fail and the process group will not be altered if:

       [ESRCH]
               The requested process does not exist.

       [EPERM]
               The effective user ID of the  requested  process  is  different
               from  that of the caller and the process is not a descendent of
               the calling process.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       [1mSetpgid[22m() conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1‚Äê1988 (‚ÄúPOSIX‚Äù).

[1mCOMPATIBILITY[0m
       [1mSetpgrp[22m() is identical to [1msetpgid[22m(), and is retained for  calling  con‚Äê
       vention compatibility with historical versions of BSD.
