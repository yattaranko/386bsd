[1mNAME[0m
       close ‚Äî delete a descriptor

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1mclose[22m([4mint[24m [4md[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mclose[22m() call deletes a descriptor from the per‚Äêprocess object ref‚Äê
       erence table.  If this is the last reference to the underlying  object,
       the  object  will  be deactivated.  For example, on the last close of a
       file the current [4mseek[24m pointer associated with the file is lost; on  the
       last close of a [4msocket[24m(2) associated naming information and queued data
       are discarded; on the last close of a file holding an advisory lock the
       lock is released (see further [4mflock[24m(2)).

       When  a  process  exits, all associated file descriptors are freed, but
       since there is a limit on active descriptors per processes, the [1mclose[22m()
       function call is useful when a large quanitity of file descriptors  are
       being handled.

       When  a  process forks (see [4mfork[24m(2)), all descriptors for the new child
       process reference the same objects as they did in the parent before the
       fork.  If a new process is then to be run using [4mexecve[24m(2), the  process
       would  normally inherit these descriptors.  Most of the descriptors can
       be rearranged with [4mdup2[24m(2) or deleted with [1mclose[22m() before the [4mexecve[24m is
       attempted, but if some of these descriptors will still be needed if the
       execve fails, it is necessary to arrange for them to be closed  if  the
       execve  succeeds.   For this reason, the call ‚Äú[1mfcntl(d, F_SETFD, 1)[22m‚Äù is
       provided, which arranges that a descriptor will be closed after a  suc‚Äê
       cessful  execve;  the call ‚Äú[1mfcntl(d, F_SETFD, 0)[22m‚Äù restores the default,
       which is to not close the descriptor.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion, a value of 0  is  returned.   Otherwise,  a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and the global integer variable [4merrno[24m is set to
       indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mClose[22m() will fail if:

       [EBADF]            [4mD[24m is not an active descriptor.

       [EINTR]            An interupt was received.
