       [1mmmap[22m([4mcaddr_t[24m [4maddr[24m, [4mint[24m [4mlen[24m, [4mint[24m [4mprot[24m, [4mint[24m [4mflags[24m, [4mint[24m [4mfd[24m, [4moff_t[24m [4moffset[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mmmap [22mfunction causes the pages starting at [4maddr[24m and continuing for
       at most [4mlen[24m bytes to be mapped from the object described by [4mfd[24m,  start‚Äê
       ing  at  byte offset [4moffset[24m.  If [4moffset[24m or [4mlen[24m is not a multiple of the
       pagesize, the mapped region may extend past the specified range.

       If [4maddr[24m is non‚Äêzero, it is used as a hint to the system.  (As a  conve‚Äê
       nience  to the system, the actual address of the region may differ from
       the address supplied.)  If [4maddr[24m is zero, an address will be selected by
       the system.  The actual starting address of the region is returned.   A
       successful  [4mmmap[24m  deletes any previous mapping in the allocated address
       range.

       The protections (region accessibility) are specified in the [4mprot[24m  argu‚Äê
       ment by [4mor[24m‚Äôing the following values:

       PROT_EXEC   Pages may be executed.

       PROT_READ   Pages may be read.

       PROT_WRITE  Pages may be written.

       The  [4mflags[24m  parameter  specifies the type of the mapped object, mapping
       options and whether modifications made to the mapped copy of  the  page
       are  private  to the process or are to be shared with other references.
       Sharing, mapping type and options are specified in the  [4mflags[24m  argument
       by [4mor[24m‚Äôing the following values:

       MAP_ANON    Map anonymous memory not associated with any specific file.
                   The  file  descriptor used for creating MAP_ANON regions is
                   used only for naming, and may be specified as -1 if no name
                   is associated with the region.

       MAP_FILE    Mapped from a regular file or character‚Äêspecial device mem‚Äê
                   ory.

       MAP_FIXED   Do not permit the system to select a different address than
                   the one specified.  If  the  specified  address  cannot  be
                   used, [1mmmap [22mwill fail.  If MAP_FIXED is specified, [4maddr[24m must
                   be  a multiple of the pagesize.  Use of this option is dis‚Äê
                   couraged.

       MAP_HASSEMAPHORE
                   Notify the kernel that the region  may  contain  semaphores
                   and that special handling may be necessary.

       MAP_INHERIT
                   Permit regions to be inherited across [4mexec[24m(2) system calls.

       MAP_PRIVATE
                   Modifications are private.

       MAP_SHARED  Modifications are shared.

       The  [4mclose[24m(2)  function does not unmap pages, see [4mmunmap[24m(2) for further
       information.

       The current design does not allow a process to specify the location  of
       swap  space.   In  the future we may define an additional mapping type,
       MAP_SWAP, in which the file descriptor argument specifies a file or de‚Äê
       vice to which swapping should be done.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion, [1mmmap [22mreturns a pointer to  the  mapped  re‚Äê
       gion.   Otherwise,  a value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indi‚Äê
       cate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mMmap[22m() will fail if:

       [EACCES]           The flag PROT_READ was specified as part of the [4mprot[0m
                          parameter and [4mfd[24m was  not  open  for  reading.   The
                          flags  PROT_WRITE,  MAP_SHARED  and  MAP_WRITE  were
                          specified as part of the [4mflags[24m and  [4mprot[24m  parameters
                          and [4mfd[24m was not open for writing.

       [EBADF]            is not a valid open file descriptor.

       [EINVAL]           One  of  MAP_ANON  or  MAP_FILE was not specified as
                          part of the [4mflags[24m parameter.  MAP_FIXED  was  speci‚Äê
                          fied  and  the  parameter was not page aligned.  did
                          not reference a regular or character special file.

       [ENOMEM]           MAP_FIXED  was  specified  and  the  [4maddr[24m  parameter
                          wasn‚Äôt  available.  MAP_ANON was specified an insuf‚Äê
                          ficient memory was available.
