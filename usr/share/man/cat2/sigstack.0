[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mSigstack[22m()  allows  users to define an alternate stack on which signals
       are to be processed.  If [4mss[24m is non‚Äêzero, it specifies a [4msignal[24m [4mstack[24m on
       which to deliver signals and tells the system if the  process  is  cur‚Äê
       rently  executing  on that stack.  When a signal‚Äôs action indicates its
       handler should execute on the signal stack (specified with a  [4msigvec[24m(2)
       call),  the  system checks to see if the process is currently executing
       on that stack.  If the process is not currently executing on the signal
       stack, the system arranges a switch to the signal stack for  the  dura‚Äê
       tion  of  the signal handler‚Äôs execution.  If [4moss[24m is non‚Äêzero, the cur‚Äê
       rent signal stack state is returned.

[1mNOTES[0m
       Signal stacks are not ‚Äò‚Äògrown‚Äô‚Äô automatically, as is done for the  nor‚Äê
       mal stack.  If the stack overflows unpredictable results may occur.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon  successful  completion,  a  value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mSigstack[22m() will fail and the signal stack context will remain unchanged
       if one of the following occurs.

       [EFAULT]  Either [4mss[24m or [4moss[24m points to memory that is not a valid part of
                 the process address space.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4msigvec[24m(2), [4msetjmp[24m(3)

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1msigstack [22mfunction call appeared in 4.2BSD.
