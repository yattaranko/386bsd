[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mMkfifo[22m()  creates  a  new fifo file with name [4mpath[24m.  The access permis‚Äê

       ing process.

       The fifo‚Äôs owner ID is set to the process‚Äôs  effective  user  ID.   The
       fifo‚Äôs  group  ID is set to that of the parent directory in which it is
       created.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       A 0 return value indicates success.  A ‚Äê1 return value indicates an er‚Äê

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mMkfifo[22m() will fail and no fifo will be created if:

       [ENOTSUPP]  The kernel has not been configured to support fifo‚Äôs.

       [ENOTDIR]   A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]    The pathname contains a character with the  high‚Äêorder  bit
                   set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A  component  of  a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]    A component of the path prefix does not exist.

       [EACCES]    Search permission is denied for a  component  of  the  path
                   prefix.

       [ELOOP]     Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

       [EPERM]     The  [4mpath[24m  argument contains a byte with the high‚Äêorder bit
                   set.

       [EROFS]     The named file resides on a read‚Äêonly file system.

       [EEXIST]    The named file exists.

       [ENOSPC]    The directory in which the entry for the new fifo is  being
                   placed cannot be extended because there is no space left on
                   the file system containing the directory.

       [ENOSPC]    There  are  no  free inodes on the file system on which the
                   fifo is being created.

       [EDQUOT]    The directory in which the entry for the new fifo is  being
                   placed  cannot be extended because the user‚Äôs quota of disk
                   blocks on the file system containing the directory has been
                   exhausted.

       [EDQUOT]    The user‚Äôs quota of inodes on the file system on which  the
                   fifo is being created has been exhausted.

       [EIO]       An  I/O  error occurred while making the directory entry or
                   allocating the inode.

       [EIO]       An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to  the
                   file system.

       [EFAULT]    [4mPath[24m points outside the process‚Äôs allocated address space.
