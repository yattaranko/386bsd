       [1mopen[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*path[24m, [4mint[24m [4mflags[24m, [4mmode_t[24m [4mmode[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The file name specified by [4mpath[24m is opened for reading and/or writing as
       specified by the argument [4mflags[24m and the file descriptor returned to the
       calling  process.   The  [4mflags[24m  argument may indicate the file is to be
       created if it does not exist (by specifying the O_CREAT flag), in which
       case the file is created with mode [4mmode[24m as described  in  [4mchmod[24m(2)  and
       modified by the process‚Äô umask value (see [4mumask[24m(2)).

       The flags specified are formed by [4mor[24m‚Äôing the following values

             O_RDONLY        open for reading only
             O_WRONLY        open for writing only
             O_RDWR          open for reading and writing
             O_NONBLOCK      do not block on open
             O_APPEND        append on each write
             O_CREAT         create file if it does not exist
             O_TRUNC         truncate size to 0
             O_EXCL          error if create and file exists
             O_SHLOCK        atomically obtain a shared lock
             O_EXLOCK        atomically obtain an exclusive lock

       Opening  a  file  with O_APPEND set causes each write on the file to be
       appended to the end.  If O_TRUNC is specified and the file exists,  the
       file  is  truncated  to zero length.  If O_EXCL is set with O_CREAT and
       the file already exists, [1mopen[22m() returns an error.  This may be used  to
       implement  a  simple  exclusive access locking mechanism.  If O_EXCL is
       set and the last component of the pathname is a symbolic  link,  [1mopen[22m()
       will  fail even if the symbolic link points to a non‚Äêexistent name.  If
       the O_NONBLOCK flag is specified and the [1mopen[22m() call  would  result  in
       the process being blocked for some reason (e.g., waiting for carrier on
       a dialup line), [1mopen[22m() returns immediately.  The first time the process
       attempts  to  perform I/O on the open file it will block (not currently
       implemented).

       When opening a file, a lock with [4mflock[24m(2) semantics can be obtained  by
       setting  O_SHLOCK for a shared lock, or O_EXLOCK for an exclusive lock.
       If creating a file with O_CREAT, the request for the  lock  will  never
       fail (provided that the underlying filesystem supports locking).

       If successful, [1mopen[22m() returns a non‚Äênegative integer, termed a file de‚Äê
       scriptor.  It returns ‚Äê1 on failure.  The file pointer used to mark the
       current position within the file is set to the beginning of the file.

       The  new  descriptor  is set to remain open across [4mexecve[24m system calls;
       see [4mclose[24m(2) and [4mfcntl[24m(2).

       The system imposes a limit on the number of file descriptors  open  si‚Äê
       multaneously by one process.  [4mGetdtablesize[24m(2) returns the current sys‚Äê
       tem limit.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The named file is opened unless:

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     A  component  of a pathname exceeded 255 characters,
                          or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]           O_CREAT is not set and the named file does  not  ex‚Äê
                          ist.

       [ENOENT]           A  component  of  the path name that must exist does
                          not exist.

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for a component  of  the
                          path prefix.

       [EACCES]           The  required  permissions (for reading and/or writ‚Äê
                          ing) are denied for the given flags.

       [EACCES]           O_CREAT is specified, the file does not  exist,  and
                          the  directory in which it is to be created does not
                          permit writing.

       [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links were encountered  in  trans‚Äê
                          lating the pathname.

       [EISDIR]           The  named  file  is  a directory, and the arguments
                          specify it is to be opened for writing.

       [EROFS]            The named file resides on a read‚Äêonly  file  system,
                          and the file is to be modified.

       [EMFILE]           The  process  has already reached its limit for open
                          file descriptors.

       [ENFILE]           The system file table is full.

       [ENXIO]            The named file is a character special or block  spe‚Äê
                          cial  file, and the device associated with this spe‚Äê
                          cial file does not exist.

       [EINTR]            The [1mopen [22moperation was interrupted by a signal.

       [EOPNOTSUPP]       O_SHLOCK or O_EXLOCK is specified but the underlying
                          filesystem does not support locking.

       [ENOSPC]           O_CREAT is specified, the file does not  exist,  and
                          the directory in which the entry for the new file is
                          being  placed cannot be extended because there is no
                          space left on the file system containing the  direc‚Äê
                          tory.

       [ENOSPC]           O_CREAT  is  specified, the file does not exist, and
                          there are no free inodes on the file system on which
                          the file is being created.

       [EDQUOT]           O_CREAT is specified, the file does not  exist,  and
                          the directory in which the entry for the new file is
                          being  placed  cannot be extended because the user‚Äôs
                          quota of disk blocks on the file  system  containing
                          the directory has been exhausted.

       [EDQUOT]           O_CREAT  is  specified, the file does not exist, and
                          the user‚Äôs quota of inodes on  the  file  system  on
                          which the file is being created has been exhausted.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while making the directory en‚Äê
                          try or allocating the inode for O_CREAT.

       [ETXTBSY]          The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that
                          is being executed and the [1mopen[22m() call requests write
                          access.

       [EFAULT]           [4mPath[24m  points outside the process‚Äôs allocated address
                          space.

       [EEXIST]           O_CREAT and O_EXCL were specified and the  file  ex‚Äê
                          ists.

       [EOPNOTSUPP]       An  attempt was made to open a socket (not currently
                          implemented).
