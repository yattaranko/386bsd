[1mNAME[0m
       acct ‚Äî enable or disable process accounting

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1macct[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*file[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1macct[22m() call enables or disables the collection of system accounting
       records.   If  the  argument  [4mfile[24m is a nil pointer, accounting is dis‚Äê
       abled.  If [4mfile[24m is an [4mexisting[24m pathname (null‚Äêterminated), record  col‚Äê
       lection is enabled and for every process initiated which terminates un‚Äê
       der normal conditions an accounting record is appended to [4mfile[24m.  Abnor‚Äê
       mal  conditions  of termination are reboots or other fatal system prob‚Äê
       lems.  Records for processes which never terminate can not be  produced
       by [1macct[22m().

       For  more  information  on  the  record  structure  used by [1macct[22m(), see
       [4m/usr/include/sys/acct.h[24m and [4macct[24m(5).

       This call is permitted only to the super‚Äêuser.

[1mNOTES[0m
       Accounting is automatically disabled when the file system the  account‚Äê
       ing  file  resides  on runs out of space; it is enabled when space once
       again becomes available.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       On error ‚Äê1 is returned.  The file must exist and the call may be exer‚Äê
       cised only by the super‚Äêuser.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mAcct[22m() will fail if one of the following is true:

       [EPERM]            The caller is not the super‚Äêuser.

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]           The pathname contains a character with the  high‚Äêor‚Äê

       [ENOENT]           The named file does not exist.

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for a component  of  the

       [ELOOP]            Too  many  symbolic links were encountered in trans‚Äê
                          lating the pathname.

       [EROFS]            The named file resides on a read‚Äêonly file system.

       [EFAULT]           [4mFile[24m points outside the process‚Äôs allocated  address
                          space.
