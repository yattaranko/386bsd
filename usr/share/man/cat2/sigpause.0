[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mThis interface is made obsolete by [4m[22msigsuspend[24m(2).

       [1mSigpause[22m()  assigns [4msigmask[24m to the set of masked signals and then waits
       for a signal to arrive; on return the set  of  masked  signals  is  re‚Äê
       stored.   [4mSigmask[24m  is  usually  0 to indicate that no signals are to be
       blocked.  [1mSigpause[22m() always terminates by being interrupted,  returning
       ‚Äê1 with [4merrno[24m set to EINTR
