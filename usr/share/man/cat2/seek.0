[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4moff_t[0m
       [1mlseek[22m([4mint[24m [4mfildes[24m, [4moff_t[24m [4moffset[24m, [4mint[24m [4mwhence[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mlseek[22m()  function  repositions  the  offset of the file descriptor
       [4mfildes[24m to the argument [4moffset[24m according to the  directive  [4mwhence.[24m  The
       argument  [4mfildes[24m  must be an open file descriptor.  [1mLseek[22m() repositions
       the file pointer [4mfildes[24m as follows:

             If [4mwhence[24m is SEEK_SET, the offset is set to [4moffset[24m bytes.

             If [4mwhence[24m is SEEK_CUR, the offset is set to its current  location
             plus [4moffset[24m bytes.

             If  [4mwhence[24m is SEEK_END, the offset is set to the size of the file
             plus [4moffset[24m bytes.

       The [1mlseek[22m() function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of
       the existing end‚Äêof‚Äêfile of the file. If data is later written at  this
       point,  subsequent  reads  of the data in the gap return bytes of zeros
       (until data is actualy written into the gap).

       Some devices are incapable of seeking.  The value of the pointer  asso‚Äê
       ciated with such a device is undefined.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon  successful completion, [1mlseek[22m() returns the resulting offset loca‚Äê
       tion as measured in bytes from the begining of the file.  Otherwise,  a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mLseek[22m() will fail and the file pointer will remain unchanged if:

       [EBADF]   [4mFildes[24m is not an open file descriptor.

       [ESPIPE]  [4mFildes[24m is associated with a pipe, socket, or FIFO.

       [EINVAL]  [4mWhence[24m is not a proper value.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mdup[24m(2), [4mopen[24m(2)

[1mBUGS[0m
       This  document‚Äôs use of [4mwhence[24m is incorrect English, but maintained for
       historical reasons.

[1mSTANDARDS[0m
       The [1mlseek[22m() function conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1‚Äê1988 (‚ÄúPOSIX‚Äù).
