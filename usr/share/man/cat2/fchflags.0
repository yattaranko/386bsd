[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The file whose name is given by [4mpath[24m or referenced by the descriptor [4mfd[0m
       has its flags changed to [4mflags[24m.

       Only the owner of a file (or the super‚Äêuser) may change the flags.  The
       owner  may  only  change the lower 16 bits of the flags; the super‚Äêuser
       may change all 32 bits of the flags.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, ‚Äê1 is
       returned and the global variable [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.
