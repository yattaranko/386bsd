[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mReboot[22m()  reboots the system.  Only the super‚Äêuser may reboot a machine
       on demand.  However, a reboot is invoked automatically in the event  of
       unrecoverable system failures.

       [4mHowto[24m  is  a mask of options; the system call interface allows the fol‚Äê
       lowing options, defined in  the  include  file  ‚ü®[4msys/reboot.h[24m‚ü©,  to  be
       passed to the new kernel or the new bootstrap and init programs.

       RB_AUTOBOOT   The  default,  causing  the system to reboot in its usual
                     fashion.

       RB_ASKNAME    Interpreted by the bootstrap program itself,  causing  it
                     to  prompt  on  the  console  as  to  what file should be
                     booted.  Normally, the system is  booted  from  the  file
                     ‚Äú[4mxx[24m(0,0)vmunix‚Äù, where [4mxx[24m is the default disk name, with‚Äê
                     out prompting for the file name.

       RB_DFLTROOT   Use  the  compiled  in root device.  Normally, the system
                     uses the device from which it was booted as the root  de‚Äê
                     vice  if possible.  (The default behavior is dependent on
                     the ability of the bootstrap  program  to  determine  the
                     drive  from which it was loaded, which is not possible on
                     all systems.)

       RB_DUMP       Dump kernel memory before rebooting; see [4msavecore[24m(8)  for
                     more information.

       RB_HALT       the  processor  is  simply halted; no reboot takes place.
                     This option should be used with caution.

       RB_INITNAME   An option allowing the specification of an  init  program
                     (see  [4minit[24m(8))  other  than [4m/sbin/init[24m to be run when the
                     system reboots.  This switch is not currently available.

       RB_KDB        Load the symbol table and enable a built‚Äêin  debugger  in
                     the  system.  This option will have no useful function if
                     the kernel is  not  configured  for  debugging.   Several
                     other  options  have  different  meaning if combined with
                     this option, although their use may not be  possible  via
                     the [1mreboot[22m() call.  See [4mkadb[24m(4) for more information.

       RB_NOSYNC     Normally,  the  disks are sync‚Äôd (see [4msync[24m(8)) before the
                     processor is halted or rebooted.  This option may be use‚Äê
                     ful if file system changes have been made manually or  if
                     the processor is on fire.

       RB_RDONLY     Initially  mount the root file system read‚Äêonly.  This is
                     currently the default, and this option  has  been  depre‚Äê
                     cated.

       RB_SINGLE     Normally, the reboot procedure involves an automatic disk
                     consistency   check   and   then  multi‚Äêuser  operations.
                     RB_SINGLE prevents this, booting the system with  a  sin‚Äê
                     gle‚Äêuser shell on the console.  RB_SINGLE is actually in‚Äê
                     terpreted by the [4minit[24m(8) program in the newly booted sys‚Äê
                     tem.

                     When  no  options  are given (i.e., RB_AUTOBOOT is used),
                     the system is rebooted from file ‚Äò‚Äòvmunix‚Äô‚Äô in  the  root
                     file  system  of  unit  0 of a disk chosen in a processor
                     specific way.  An  automatic  consistency  check  of  the
                     disks is normally performed (see [4mfsck[24m(8)).

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       If  successful,  this  call never returns.  Otherwise, a ‚Äê1 is returned
       and an error is returned in the global variable [4merrno[24m.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [EPERM]            The caller is not the super‚Äêuser.

       The HP300 implementation supports neither RB_DFLTROOT nor RB_KDB.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mreboot [22mfunction call appeared in 4.0BSD.
