[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  scheduling priority of the process, process group, or user, as in‚Äê
       dicated by [4mwhich[24m and [4mwho[24m is obtained with the  [1mgetpriority[22m()  call  and
       set  with  the  [1msetpriority[22m()  call.   [4mWhich[24m  is  one  of PRIO_PROCESS,
       PRIO_PGRP, or PRIO_USER, and [4mwho[24m is interpreted relative  to  [4mwhich[24m  (a
       process  identifier  for  PRIO_PROCESS,  process  group  identifier for
       PRIO_PGRP, and a user ID for PRIO_USER).  A zero value of  [4mwho[24m  denotes
       the  current  process,  process group, or user.  [4mPrio[24m is a value in the
       range ‚Äê20 to 20.  The default priority is  0;  lower  priorities  cause
       more favorable scheduling.

       The  [1mgetpriority[22m()  call returns the highest priority (lowest numerical
       value) enjoyed by any of the specified  processes.   The  [1msetpriority[22m()
       call sets the priorities of all of the specified processes to the spec‚Äê
       ified value.  Only the super‚Äêuser may lower priorities.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Since  [1mgetpriority[22m() can legitimately return the value ‚Äê1, it is neces‚Äê
       sary to clear the external variable [4merrno[24m prior to the call, then check
       it afterward to determine if a ‚Äê1 is an error or  a  legitimate  value.
       The  [1msetpriority[22m()  call returns 0 if there is no error, or ‚Äê1 if there
       is.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mGetpriority[22m() and [1msetpriority[22m() will fail if:

       [ESRCH]            No process was located using the [4mwhich[24m and [4mwho[24m  val‚Äê
                          ues specified.

       [EINVAL]           [4mWhich[24m  was  not  one  of PRIO_PROCESS, PRIO_PGRP, or
                          PRIO_USER.

       In addition to the errors indicated above, [1msetpriority[22m() will fail if:

       [EPERM]            A process was located, but neither its effective nor
                          real user ID matched the effective user  ID  of  the
                          caller.

       [EACCES]           A non super‚Äêuser attempted to lower a process prior‚Äê
                          ity.
