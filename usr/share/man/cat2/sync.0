[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mvoid[0m
       [1msync[22m([4mvoid[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1msync[22m()  function forces a write of dirty (modified) buffers in the
       block buffer cache out to disk. The kernel keeps  this  information  in
       core to reduce the number of disk I/O transfers required by the system.
       As  information in the cache is lost after a system crash a [1msync[22m() call
       is issued frequently by the user process [4mupdate[24m(8) (about every 30 sec‚Äê
       onds).

       The function [4mfsync[24m(2) may be used to synchronize  individual  file  de‚Äê
       scriptor attributes.

[1mBUGS[0m
       [1mSync[22m() may return before the buffers are completely flushed.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       A [1msync [22mfunction call appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
