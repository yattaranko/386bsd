ADJTIME(2)                    System Calls Manual                   ADJTIME(2)

[1mNAME[0m
       adjtime ‚Äî correct the time to allow synchronization of the system clock

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <sys/time.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1madjtime[22m([4mstruct[24m [4mtimeval[24m [4m*delta[24m, [4mstruct[24m [4mtimeval[24m [4m*olddelta[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mAdjtime[22m()  makes  small  adjustments to the system time, as returned by
       [4mgettimeofday[24m(2), advancing or retarding it by the time specified by the
       timeval [4mdelta[24m.  If [4mdelta[24m is negative, the clock is slowed down  by  in‚Äê
       crementing it more slowly than normal until the correction is complete.
       If [4mdelta[24m is positive, a larger increment than normal is used.  The skew
       used  to perform the correction is generally a fraction of one percent.
       Thus, the time is always a monotonically increasing function.   A  time
       correction  from  an earlier call to [1madjtime[22m() may not be finished when
       [1madjtime[22m() is called again.   If  [4molddelta[24m  is  non‚Äênil,  the  structure
       pointed  to will contain, upon return, the number of microseconds still
       to be corrected from the earlier call.

       This call may be used by time servers that synchronize  the  clocks  of
       computers  in  a local area network.  Such time servers would slow down
       the clocks of some machines and speed up the clocks of others to  bring
       them to the average network time.

       The call [1madjtime[22m() is restricted to the super‚Äêuser.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       A  return value of 0 indicates that the call succeeded.  A return value
       of ‚Äê1 indicates that an error occurred, and in this case an error  code
       is stored in the global variable [4merrno[24m.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mAdjtime[22m() will fail if:

       [EFAULT]           An  argument  points outside the process‚Äôs allocated
                          address space.

       [EPERM]            The process‚Äôs effective user ID is not that  of  the
                          super‚Äêuser.
