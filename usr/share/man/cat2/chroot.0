[1mNAME[0m
       chroot ‚Äî change root directory

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1mchroot[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*dirname[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mDirname[24m is the address of the pathname of a directory, terminated by an
       ASCII  NUL.  [1mChroot[22m() causes [4mdirname[24m to become the root directory, that
       is, the starting point for path searches of  pathnames  beginning  with
       ‚Äò/‚Äô.

       In  order  for  a directory to become the root directory a process must
       have execute (search) access for that directory.

       It should be noted that [1mchroot[22m() has no effect on the process‚Äôs current
       directory.

       This call is restricted to the super‚Äêuser.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion, a value of 0  is  returned.   Otherwise,  a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate an error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mChroot[22m() will fail and the root directory will be unchanged if:

       [ENOTDIR]  A component of the path name is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]   The  pathname  contains  a character with the high‚Äêorder bit
                  set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
                  A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an en‚Äê
                  tire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]   The named directory does not exist.

       [EACCES]   Search permission is denied for any component  of  the  path
                  name.

       [ELOOP]    Too  many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                  pathname.

       [EFAULT]   [4mPath[24m points outside the process‚Äôs allocated address space.

       [EIO]      An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing  to  the
                  file system.
