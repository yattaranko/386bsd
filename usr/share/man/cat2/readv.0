[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mRead[22m()  attempts  to  read [4mnbytes[24m of data from the object referenced by
       the descriptor [4md[24m into the buffer pointed to by [4mbuf[24m.   [1mReadv[22m()  performs
       the  same  action,  but scatters the input data into the [4miovcnt[24m buffers
       specified by the  members  of  the  [4miov[24m  array:  iov[0],  iov[1],  ...,
       iov[iovcnt-1].

       For [1mreadv[22m(), the [4miovec[24m structure is defined as
             struct iovec {
                     caddr_t iov_base;
                     int     iov_len;
             };

       Each  [4miovec[24m  entry  specifies the base address and length of an area in
       memory where data should be placed.  [1mReadv[22m() will always fill  an  area
       completely before proceeding to the next.

       On objects capable of seeking, the [1mread[22m() starts at a position given by
       the pointer associated with [4md[24m (see [4mlseek[24m(2)).  Upon return from [1mread[22m(),
       the pointer is incremented by the number of bytes actually read.

       Objects  that  are  not capable of seeking always read from the current
       position.  The value of the pointer associated with such an  object  is
       undefined.

       Upon  successful  completion,  [1mread[22m()  and [1mreadv[22m() return the number of
       bytes actually read and placed in the buffer.  The system guarantees to
       read the number of bytes requested if the descriptor references a  nor‚Äê
       mal  file  that has that many bytes left before the end‚Äêof‚Äêfile, but in
       no other case.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       If successful, the number of bytes  actually  read  is  returned.  Upon
       reading end‚Äêof‚Äêfile, zero is returned.  Otherwise, a ‚Äê1 is returned and
       the global variable [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mRead[22m() and [1mreadv[22m() will succeed unless:

       [EBADF]            [4mD[24m  is not a valid file or socket descriptor open for
                          reading.

       [EFAULT]           [4mBuf[24m points outside the allocated address space.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while reading  from  the  file
                          system.

       [EINTR]            A read from a slow device was interrupted before any
                          data arrived by the delivery of a signal.

       [EINVAL]           The pointer associated with [4md[24m was negative.

       [EWOULDBLOCK]      The  file  was  marked  for non‚Äêblocking I/O, and no
                          data were ready to be read.

       In addition, [1mreadv[22m() may return one of the following errors:

       [EINVAL]           [4mIovcnt[24m was less than or equal to 0, or greater  than
                          16.

       [EINVAL]           One of the [4miov_len[24m values in the [4miov[24m array was nega‚Äê
                          tive.

       [EINVAL]           The sum of the [4miov_len[24m values in the [4miov[24m array over‚Äê
                          flowed a 32‚Äêbit integer.

       [EFAULT]           Part  of  the [4miov[24m points outside the process‚Äôs allo‚Äê
                          cated address space.
