       [1mconnect[22m([4mint[24m [4ms[24m, [4mstruct[24m [4msockaddr[24m [4m*name[24m, [4mint[24m [4mnamelen[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  parameter  [4ms[24m  is a socket.  If it is of type SOCK_DGRAM, this call
       specifies the peer with which the socket is to be associated; this  ad‚Äê
       dress  is  that to which datagrams are to be sent, and the only address
       from which datagrams are to be received.  If  the  socket  is  of  type
       SOCK_STREAM, this call attempts to make a connection to another socket.
       The  other socket is specified by [4mname[24m, which is an address in the com‚Äê
       munications space of the socket.  Each communications space  interprets
       the  [4mname[24m parameter in its own way.  Generally, stream sockets may suc‚Äê
       cessfully [1mconnect[22m() only once; datagram sockets may use [1mconnect[22m()  mul‚Äê
       tiple times to change their association.  Datagram sockets may dissolve
       the association by connecting to an invalid address, such as a null ad‚Äê
       dress.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       If  the  connection or binding succeeds, 0 is returned.  Otherwise a ‚Äê1
       is returned, and a more specific error code is stored in [4merrno[24m.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The [1mconnect[22m() call fails if:

       [EBADF]           [4mS[24m is not a valid descriptor.

       [ENOTSOCK]        [4mS[24m is a descriptor for a file, not a socket.

       [EADDRNOTAVAIL]   The specified address is not available  on  this  ma‚Äê
                         chine.

       [EAFNOSUPPORT]    Addresses  in  the specified address family cannot be
                         used with this socket.

       [EISCONN]         The socket is already connected.

       [ETIMEDOUT]       Connection establishment timed out without establish‚Äê
                         ing a connection.

       [ECONNREFUSED]    The attempt to connect was forcefully rejected.

       [ENETUNREACH]     The network isn‚Äôt reachable from this host.

       [EADDRINUSE]      The address is already in use.

       [EFAULT]          The [4mname[24m parameter  specifies  an  area  outside  the
                         process address space.

       [EINPROGRESS]     The  socket is non‚Äêblocking and the connection cannot
                         be  completed  immediately.   It   is   possible   to
                         [4mselect[24m(2)  for completion by selecting the socket for
                         writing.

       [EALREADY]        The socket is non‚Äêblocking and a previous  connection
                         attempt has not yet been completed.

       The  following  errors are specific to connecting names in the UNIX do‚Äê
       main.  These errors may not apply in future versions of  the  UNIX  IPC
       domain.

       [ENOTDIR]         A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]          The pathname contains a character with the high‚Äêorder
                         bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]    A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or
                         an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]          The named socket does not exist.

       [EACCES]          Search  permission  is  denied for a component of the
                         path prefix.

       [EACCES]          Write access to the named socket is denied.

       [ELOOP]           Too many symbolic links were encountered in translat‚Äê
                         ing the pathname.
