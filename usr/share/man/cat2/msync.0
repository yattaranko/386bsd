[1mNAME[0m
       msync - synchronize a mapped region

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       msync(addr, len)

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [4mmsync[24m system call writes any modified pages back to the filesystem
       and updates the file modification time.  If  [4mlen[24m  is  0,  all  modified
       pages within the region containing [4maddr[24m will be flushed; if [4mlen[24m is non‚Äê
       zero,  only the pages containing [4maddr[24m and [4mlen[24m succeeding locations will
       be examined.  Any required synchronization of memory caches  will  also
       take  place  at  this  time.   Filesystem  operations on a file that is
       mapped for shared  modifications  are  unpredictable  except  after  an
       [4mmsync[24m.
