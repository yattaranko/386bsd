[1mNAME[0m
       bind ‚Äî bind a name to a socket

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <sys/types.h>[0m
       [1m#include <sys/socket.h>[0m

       [1mbind[22m([4mint[24m [4ms[24m, [4mstruct[24m [4msockaddr[24m [4m*name[24m, [4mint[24m [4mnamelen[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mBind[22m()  assigns  a name to an unnamed socket.  When a socket is created
       with [4msocket[24m(2) it exists in a name space (address family)  but  has  no
       name assigned.  [1mBind[22m() requests that [4mname[24m be assigned to the socket.

[1mNOTES[0m
       Binding  a  name in the UNIX domain creates a socket in the file system
       that must be deleted by the caller when it is no longer  needed  (using
       [4munlink[24m(2)).

       The  rules  used  in  name  binding vary between communication domains.
       Consult the manual entries in section 4 for detailed information.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       If the bind is successful, a 0 value is returned.  A return value of ‚Äê1
       indicates an error, which is further specified in the global [4merrno[24m.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The [1mbind[22m() call will fail if:

       [EBADF]      [4mS[24m is not a valid descriptor.

       [ENOTSOCK]   [4mS[24m is not a socket.

       [EADDRNOTAVAIL]
                    The specified address is not available from the local  ma‚Äê
                    chine.

       [EADDRINUSE]
                    The specified address is already in use.

       [EINVAL]     The socket is already bound to an address.

       [EACCES]     The  requested  address is protected, and the current user
                    has inadequate permission to access it.

       [EFAULT]     The [4mname[24m parameter is not in a valid part of the user  ad‚Äê
                    dress space.

       The following errors are specific to binding names in the UNIX domain.

       [ENOTDIR]    A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]     The  pathname contains a character with the high‚Äêorder bit
                    set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
                    A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters,  or  an
                    entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]     A prefix component of the path name does not exist.

       [ELOOP]      Too  many  symbolic  links were encountered in translating
                    the pathname.

       [EIO]        An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry  or
                    allocating the inode.

       [EROFS]      The name would reside on a read‚Äêonly file system.

       [EISDIR]     An empty pathname was specified.
