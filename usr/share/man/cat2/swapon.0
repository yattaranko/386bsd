[1mNAME[0m
       swapon ‚Äî add a swap device for interleaved paging/swapping

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1mswapon[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*special[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mSwapon[22m() makes the block device [4mspecial[24m available to the system for al‚Äê
       location  for  paging and swapping.  The names of potentially available
       devices are known to the system and  defined  at  system  configuration
       time.   The  size of the swap area on [4mspecial[24m is calculated at the time
       the device is first made available for swapping.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       If an error has occurred, a value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to
       indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mSwapon[22m() succeeds unless:

       [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]      The pathname contains a character with the high‚Äêorder bit
                     set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
                     A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or  an
                     entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]      The named device does not exist.

       [EACCES]      Search  permission  is denied for a component of the path
                     prefix.

       [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered  in  translating
                     the pathname.

       [EPERM]       The caller is not the super‚Äêuser.

       [ENOTBLK]     [4mSpecial[24m is not a block device.

       [EBUSY]       The  device  specified  by  [4mspecial[24m has already been made
                     available for swapping

       [EINVAL]      The device configured by [4mspecial[24m was not configured  into
                     the system as a swap device.

       [ENXIO]       The  major device number of [4mspecial[24m is out of range (this
                     indicates no device  driver  exists  for  the  associated
                     hardware).

       [EIO]         An I/O error occurred while opening the swap device.

       [EFAULT]      [4mSpecial[24m  points  outside  the process‚Äôs allocated address
                     space.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
       [4mswapon[24m(8), [4mconfig[24m(8)

[1mBUGS[0m
       There is no way to stop swapping on a disk so that the pack may be dis‚Äê
       mounted.

       This call will be upgraded in future versions of the system.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mswapon [22mfunction call appeared in 4.0BSD.
