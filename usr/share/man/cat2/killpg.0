[1mNAME[0m
       killpg ‚Äî send signal to a process group

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <sys/signal.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1mkillpg[22m([4mpid_t[24m [4mpgrp[24m, [4mint[24m [4msig[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mKillpg[22m()  sends  the  signal  [4msig[24m  to  the  process  group  [4mpgrp[24m.   See
       [4msigaction[24m(2) for a list of signals.  If [4mpgrp[24m is 0, [1mkillpg[22m()  sends  the
       signal to the sending process‚Äôs process group.

       The sending process and members of the process group must have the same
       effective  user  ID, or the sender must be the super‚Äêuser.  As a single
       special case the continue signal SIGCONT may be  sent  to  any  process
       that is a descendant of the current process.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon  successful  completion,  a  value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and the global variable [4merrno[24m is set  to  indi‚Äê
       cate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mKillpg[22m() will fail and no signal will be sent if:

       [EINVAL]           [4mSig[24m is not a valid signal number.

       [ESRCH]            No  process can be found in the process group speci‚Äê
                          fied by [4mpgrp[24m.

       [ESRCH]            The process group was given as  0  but  the  sending
                          process does not have a process group.

       [EPERM]            The sending process is not the super‚Äêuser and one or
                          more  of  the target processes has an effective user
                          ID different from that of the sending process.
