[1mNAME[0m
       listen ‚Äî listen for connections on a socket

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <sys/socket.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1mlisten[22m([4mint[24m [4ms[24m, [4mint[24m [4mbacklog[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       To  accept  connections,  a  socket  is first created with [4msocket[24m(2), a
       willingness to accept incoming connections and a queue limit for incom‚Äê
       ing connections are specified with [1mlisten[22m(), and then  the  connections
       are accepted with [4maccept[24m(2).  The [1mlisten[22m() call applies only to sockets
       of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.

       The  [4mbacklog[24m  parameter defines the maximum length the queue of pending
       connections may grow to.  If a  connection  request  arrives  with  the
       queue  full  the  client  may  receive  an  error with an indication of
       ECONNREFUSED, or, if the underlying protocol  supports  retransmission,
       the request may be ignored so that retries may succeed.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       A 0 return value indicates success; ‚Äê1 indicates an error.

[1mERRORS[0m
