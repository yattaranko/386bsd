[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [4mpath[24m  arument  points to the pathname of a directory.  The [1mchdir[22m()
       function causes the named directory to become the current  working  di‚Äê
       rectory, that is, the starting point for path searches of pathnames not
       beginning with a slash, ‚Äò/‚Äô.

       The  [1mfchdir[22m()  function causes the directory referenced by [4mfd[24m to become
       the current working directory, the starting point for path searches  of
       pathnames not beginning with a slash, ‚Äò/‚Äô.

       In  order  for  a  directory to become the current directory, a process
       must have execute (search) access to the directory.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion, a value of 0  is  returned.   Otherwise,  a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mChdir[22m()  will  fail and the current working directory will be unchanged
       if one or more of the following are true:

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]           The pathname contains a character with the  high‚Äêor‚Äê
                          der bit set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     A  component  of a pathname exceeded 255 characters,
                          or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]           The named directory does not exist.

       [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links were encountered  in  trans‚Äê
                          lating the pathname.

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for any component of the
                          path name.

       [EFAULT]           [4mPath[24m  points outside the process‚Äôs allocated address
                          space.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while reading from or  writing
                          to the file system.

       [1mFchdir[22m()  will fail and the current working directory will be unchanged
       if one or more of the following are true:

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for the directory refer‚Äê
                          enced by the file descriptor.

       [ENOTDIR]          The file descriptor does not reference a directory.

       [EBADF]            The argument [4mfd[24m is not a valid file descriptor.
