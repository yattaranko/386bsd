[1mNAME[0m
       truncate ‚Äî truncate a file to a specified length

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1m#include <unistd.h>[0m

       [4mint[0m
       [1mtruncate[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*path[24m, [4moff_t[24m [4mlength[24m);

       [4mint[0m
       [1mftruncate[22m([4mint[24m [4mfd[24m, [4moff_t[24m [4mlength[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mTruncate[22m()  causes  the  file  named  by [4mpath[24m or referenced by [4mfd[24m to be
       truncated to at most [4mlength[24m bytes in size.  If the file previously  was
       larger  than  this size, the extra data is lost.  With [1mftruncate[22m(), the
       file must be open for writing.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       A value of 0 is returned if the call succeeds.  If the call fails a  ‚Äê1
       is returned, and the global variable [4merrno[24m specifies the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mTruncate[22m() succeeds unless:

       [ENOTDIR]  A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EINVAL]   The  pathname  contains  a character with the high‚Äêorder bit
                  set.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
                  A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an en‚Äê
                  tire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]   The named file does not exist.

       [EACCES]   Search permission is denied for a component of the path pre‚Äê
                  fix.

       [EACCES]   The named file is not writable by the user.

       [ELOOP]    Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating  the
                  pathname.

       [EISDIR]   The named file is a directory.

       [EROFS]    The named file resides on a read‚Äêonly file system.

                  ing executed.

       [EIO]      An I/O error occurred updating the inode.

       [EFAULT]   [4mPath[24m points outside the process‚Äôs allocated address space.

       [1mFtruncate[22m() succeeds unless:

       [EBADF]    The [4mfd[24m is not a valid descriptor.

       [EINVAL]   The [4mfd[24m references a socket, not a file.

       [EINVAL]   The [4mfd[24m is not open for writing.

[1mBUGS[0m
       These calls should be generalized to allow ranges of bytes in a file to
       be discarded.
