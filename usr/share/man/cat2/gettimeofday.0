[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mNote:  timezone is no longer used; this information is kept outside the[0m
       [1mkernel.  [22mThe system‚Äôs notion of the current Greenwich time and the cur‚Äê
       rent time zone is obtained with the [1mgettimeofday[22m() call, and  set  with
       the  [1msettimeofday[22m()  call.   The  time  is expressed in seconds and mi‚Äê
       croseconds since midnight (0 hour), January 1, 1970.  The resolution of
       the system clock is hardware dependent, and the  time  may  be  updated
       continuously  or  in  ‚Äò‚Äòticks.‚Äô‚Äô   If [4mtp[24m or [4mtzp[24m is NULL, the associated
       time information will not be returned or set.

       The structures pointed to by [4mtp[24m and [4mtzp[24m are defined in ‚ü®[4msys/time.h[24m‚ü© as:

       struct timeval {
               long    tv_sec;         /* seconds since Jan. 1, 1970 */
               long    tv_usec;        /* and microseconds */
       };

       struct timezone {
               int     tz_minuteswest; /* of Greenwich */
               int     tz_dsttime;     /* type of dst correction to apply */
       };

       The [4mtimezone[24m structure indicates the local time zone (measured in  min‚Äê
       utes of time westward from Greenwich), and a flag that, if nonzero, in‚Äê
       dicates  that Daylight Saving time applies locally during the appropri‚Äê
       ate part of the year.

       Only the super‚Äêuser may set the time of day or time zone.

[1mRETURN[0m
       A 0 return value indicates that the call succeeded.  A ‚Äê1 return  value
       indicates  an  error occurred, and in this case an error code is stored
       into the global variable [4merrno[24m.

[1mERRORS[0m
       The following error codes may be set in [4merrno[24m:

       [EFAULT]  An argument address referenced invalid memory.

       [EPERM]   A user other than the super‚Äêuser attempted to set the time.

[1mHISTORY[0m
       The [1mgettimeofday [22mfunction call appeared in 4.2BSD.
