       [1mutimes[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*file[24m, [4mconst[24m [4mstruct[24m [4mtimeval[24m [4m*times[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mutimes[22m()  function  sets  the access and modification times of the
       named file from the structures in the argument array [4mtimes[24m.

       The first structure is the access time, and the second is the modifica‚Äê
       tion time.

       If the times are specified (the [4mtimes[24m argument is non‚ÄêNULL) the  caller
       must be the owner of the file or be the super‚Äêuser.

       If  the times are not specified (the [4mtimes[24m argument is NULL) the caller
       must be the owner of the file, have permission to write the file, or be
       the super‚Äêuser.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion, a value of 0  is  returned.   Otherwise,  a
       value of ‚Äê1 is returned and [4merrno[24m is set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mUtimes[22m() will fail if:

       [EACCES]           Search  permission  is denied for a component of the
                          path prefix; or the [4mtimes[24m argument is NULL  and  the
                          effective  user ID of the process does not match the
                          owner of the file, and is not  the  super‚Äêuser,  and
                          write access is denied.

       [EFAULT]           [4mFile[24m or [4mtimes[24m points outside the process‚Äôs allocated
                          address space.

       [EINVAL]           The  pathname contains a character with the high‚Äêor‚Äê
                          der bit set.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while reading or  writing  the
                          affected inode.

       [ELOOP]            Too  many  symbolic links were encountered in trans‚Äê
                          lating the pathname.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     A component of a pathname exceeded  255  characters,
                          or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       [ENOENT]           The named file does not exist.

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EPERM]            The  [4mtimes[24m  argument  is  not  NULL  and the calling
                          process‚Äôs effective user ID does not match the owner
                          of the file and is not the super‚Äêuser.

       [EROFS]            The file system containing the file is mounted read‚Äê
                          only.
