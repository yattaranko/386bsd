       [1mwritev[22m([4mint[24m [4md[24m, [4mstruct[24m [4miovec[24m [4m*iov[24m, [4mint[24m [4miovcnt[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mWrite[22m()  attempts  to  write [4mnbytes[24m of data to the object referenced by
       the descriptor [4md[24m from the buffer pointed to by [4mbuf[24m.  [1mWritev[22m()  performs
       the  same  action,  but gathers the output data from the [4miovcnt[24m buffers
       specified by the  members  of  the  [4miov[24m  array:  iov[0],  iov[1],  ...,
       iov[iovcnt‚Äê1].

       For [1mwritev[22m(), the [4miovec[24m structure is defined as:
             struct iovec {
                     caddr_t iov_base;
                     int     iov_len;
             };

       Each  [4miovec[24m  entry  specifies the base address and length of an area in
       memory from which data should be written.  [1mWritev[22m() will always write a
       complete area before proceeding to the next.

       On objects capable of seeking, the [1mwrite[22m() starts at a  position  given
       by  the  pointer  associated  with  [4md[24m,  see [4mlseek[24m(2).  Upon return from
       [1mwrite[22m(), the pointer is incremented by the number of bytes  which  were
       written.

       Objects  that  are not capable of seeking always write from the current
       position.  The value of the pointer associated with such an  object  is
       undefined.

       If  the  real  user is not the super‚Äêuser, then [1mwrite[22m() clears the set‚Äê
       user‚Äêid bit on a file.  This prevents penetration of system security by
       a user who ‚Äúcaptures‚Äù a writable set‚Äêuser‚Äêid file owned by  the  super‚Äê
       user.

       When using non‚Äêblocking I/O on objects such as sockets that are subject
       to  flow  control,  [1mwrite[22m() and [1mwritev[22m() may write fewer bytes than re‚Äê
       quested; the return value must be noted, and the remainder of the oper‚Äê
       ation should be retried when possible.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       Upon successful completion the number of bytes which  were  written  is
       returned.   Otherwise a ‚Äê1 is returned and the global variable [4merrno[24m is
       set to indicate the error.

[1mERRORS[0m
       [1mWrite[22m() and [1mwritev[22m() will fail and the file  pointer  will  remain  un‚Äê
       changed if:

       [EBADF]            [4mD[24m is not a valid descriptor open for writing.

       [EPIPE]            An  attempt  is  made to write to a pipe that is not
                          open for reading by any process.

       [EPIPE]            An attempt is made to write to a socket of type that
                          is not connected to a peer socket.

       [EFBIG]            An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the
                          process‚Äôs file size limit or the maximum file size.

       [EFAULT]           Part of [4miov[24m or data to be written to the file points
                          outside the process‚Äôs allocated address space.

       [EINVAL]           The pointer associated with [4md[24m was negative.

       [ENOSPC]           There is no free space remaining on the file  system
                          containing the file.

       [EDQUOT]           The  user‚Äôs  quota of disk blocks on the file system
                          containing the file has been exhausted.

       [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while reading from or  writing
                          to the file system.

       [EWOULDBLOCK]      The  file  was  marked  for non‚Äêblocking I/O, and no
                          data could be written immediately.

       In addition, [1mwritev[22m() may return one of the following errors:

       [EINVAL]           [4mIovcnt[24m was less than or equal to 0, or greater  than
                          16.

       [EINVAL]           One of the [4miov_len[24m values in the [4miov[24m array was nega‚Äê
                          tive.

       [EINVAL]           The sum of the [4miov_len[24m values in the [4miov[24m array over‚Äê
                          flowed a 32‚Äêbit integer.
